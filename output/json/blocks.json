    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of North-East England. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nFor north-east England, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tthe pre-Devensian glacial and interglacial record\r\n•\tthe Devensian glacial record\r\n•\tThe Late-glacial record\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and slope deposits\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Name": "Quaternary of South Central England",
    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of south-central England. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nSouth-West England, with its unglaciated granite landscapes, periglacial formations and raised beach deposits, is quite distinctive in its characteristics from, say, the Thames Valley, East Anglia or Scotland. Each of these regions offers a distinctive contribution to the overall picture of Quaternary landscapes and environments in Britain. A prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance. Indeed, all the sites selected for the GCR Series are considered to be at least of national importance.\r\nFor south-central England, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tlong-term landscape evolution\r\n•\tPleistocene sea-level changes\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and deposits\r\n•\tkey sequences of deposits for interpreting the distinctive Quaternary history of the region\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of south-east England. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nSouth-West England, with its unglaciated granite landscapes, periglacial formations and raised beach deposits, is quite distinctive in its characteristics from, say, the Thames Valley, East Anglia or Scotland. Each of these regions offers a distinctive contribution to the overall picture of Quaternary landscapes and environments in Britain. A prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance. Indeed, all the sites selected for the GCR Series are considered to be at least of national importance.\r\nFor south-east England, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tlong-term landscape evolution\r\n•\tPleistocene sea-level changes\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and deposits\r\n•\tkey sequences of deposits for interpreting the distinctive Quaternary history of the region\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 157 to 155 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first part of the Late Jurassic Epoch, which spans from 157 to 140 Ma and is followed by the Kimmeridgian Age (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=40' title='Click for details of GCR Block Kimmeridgian'>KIM</a>). Rocks that formed during the Late Jurassic Epoch (part of the Jurassic Period) constitute the Upper Jurassic Series (part of the Jurassic System).\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nOn maps showing the solid geology of England, Upper Jurassic rocks crop out in an almost continuous strip from the Dorset coast to the North Yorkshire coast. In Scotland, Upper Jurassic rocks crop out in scattered patches in the islands to the north-west as well as in northern Scotland. The Corallian facies is well-known because it forms the hilly ground between Dorset and Oxford, and also in North Yorkshire\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nTowards the end of the Mid Jurassic Epoch there was a significant marine transgression across much of Britain, drowning the varied shallow marine, fluvial, deltaic, saltmarsh and coastal lagoonal environments that had gone before. Thus, by the beginning of the Oxfordian Age, a shallow shelf sea was established over much of Britain. Sea levels rose throughout the Oxfordian Age and mudrock deposition was widespread, although limestones and sandstones of the ‘Corallian’ facies (near-shore or shallow water deposits) had developed by the end of early Oxfordian times.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into five themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting largely controlled by deep-seated structural features. The networks are:\r\n•\tDorset to Oxford (Wessex Basin, and western margins of the ‘London Platform’)\r\n•\tEast Midlands (East Midlands Shelf)\r\n•\tNorth Yorkshire (Cleveland Basin)\r\n•\tScotland (Moray Firth and Hebrides basins)\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nInvertebrate faunas included abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). Corals became a significant part of the fauna where there was carbonate sedimentation, along with sponges, bryozoa, echinoids and gastropds. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and marine crocodiless. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times but in Britain the Upper Jurassic record is fully marine.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Jurassic-Cretaceous Reptilia GCR Block represent the British fossil record of terrestrial and aquatic reptiles of the last two periods of the the Mesozoic Era (which spanned from 230 to 65 million years ago (Ma)). At the end of the Cretaceous Period (the last Period of the Mesozoic era) there was a major, global mass-extinction event (the ‘K-T’ event [Cretaceous-Tertiary]), and this had a significant effect on the faunas of the time, with approximatley 85% of species becoming extinct. The Jurassic-Cretaceous time is maked by the emergence and rise of the dinosaurs, thus enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a developing, but characteristic, faunal distinctiveness.\r\nEarlier fossil reptiles are afforded their own GCR Blocks, ‘Permian-Triassic Reptilia’and later reptiles are selected for the ‘Tertiary Reptilia’ Block. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=71' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic Reptilia'>PER-TRI-RP</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=97' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Reptilia'>TER-REP</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe reptiles evolved from their amphibian forebears over 300 million years ago. The oldest postulated fossil reptile is known from the Carboniferous of Scotland. Reptiles radiated extensively during the Permian Period and the Mesozoic Era, a span of time often referred to as the ‘Age of Reptiles’. Britain’s fossil reptile sites include key Triassic sites that document the pre-dinosaur times, and the unique dinosaurian faunas of Mid Jurassic and Early Cretaceous age. Marine reptiles (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, crocodilians) are richly represented in the Early and Late Jurassic in particular. A number of Tertiary localities have yielded rich faunas of turtles, crocodilians and squamates. Pterosaurs\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe palaeogeography of each relevant geological ages periods of Jurassic and Cretaceous periods can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website.

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Permian –Triassic Reptilia GCR Block represent the British fossil record of terrestrial and aquatic reptiles of the last period of the Palaeozoic Era (the Permian Period, spanning from 280 to 230 million years ago (Ma), and the first period fo the Mesozoic Era (the Triassic Period, from 230 to 195Ma), effectively charting the early evolution of the group from its emergence as represented by the record in Britain. At the end of the Permian Period there was a major, global mass-extinction event, and this had a significant effect on the faunas of the time, with approximatley 95% of species becoming extinct. After the pre-dinosaurian faunas of the Triassic, the Jurassic-Cretaceous time is maked by the emergence and rise of the dinosaurs, thus enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a developing, but characteristic, faunal distinctiveness.\r\nLater fossil reptiles are afforded their own GCR Blocks, ‘Jurassic-Cretaceous Reptilia’ and ‘Tertiary Reptilia’. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=38' title='Click for details of GCR Block Jurassic - Cretaceous Reptilia'>JUR-CRE-RP</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=97' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Reptilia'>TER-REP</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe reptiles evolved from their amphibian forebears over 300 million years ago. The oldest postulated fossil reptile is known from the Carboniferous of Scotland. Reptiles radiated extensively during the Permian Period and the Mesozoic Era, a span of time often referred to as the ‘Age of Reptiles’. Britain’s fossil reptile sites include key Triassic sites that document the pre-dinosaur times, and the unique dinosaurian faunas of Mid Jurassic and Early Cretaceous age. Marine reptiles (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, crocodilians) are richly represented in the Early and Late Jurassic in particular. A number of Tertiary localities have yielded rich faunas of turtles, crocodilians and squamates. \r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe palaeogeography of each relevant geological ages of Permian and Triassic periods can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website. See PER–TRI and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=91' title='Click for details of GCR Block Rhaetian'>RTN</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nOwing to the rarity of fossil reptile material, this GCR Block represents something of a special case with regard to including all of the sites yielding, or that have yielded, significant types and quantities of scientifically important material that help elucidate the evolution, diversification and extinction of the main reptile groups.\r\nThe sites selected for this Block aim to represent distinct reptile assemblages showing diversification and extinction associated with the Permian and Triassic periods.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 354 to 327 million years ago (Ma) as represented by rocks in Northern England and North Wales. This interval is the first part of the Carboniferous Period, which spans from about 354 to 292 Ma. Rocks that formed during the during Dinantian time constitute the Dinantian Subsystem, which comprises the Tournaisian and Visean series, in turn made up from the Courceyan, Chadian, Arundian, Holkerian, Asbian and Brigantian stages. In the GCR, the Dinantian Subsystem plus Pendleian and Arnsbergian stages (the lowest two stages of the overlying Silesian Subsystem) are equated with Lower Carboniferous (or Mississipian) Subsystem.\r\nThe majority of the stages are defined at stratotype sections, either in northern England, South Wales or southern Ireland, but a stratotype section for the Arnsbergian Stage has yet to be established.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe major features controlling deposition in Britain during Early Carboniferous times owe much to structures inherited from the Caledonian Orogeny. (See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>). Closure of the Iapetus Ocean had led to the development of a suture running ENE–WSW across northern England, with differing Lower Palaeozoic geological histories on either side.The Caledonian structure of England and Wales was strongly influenced by a ‘Midlands Microcraton’ in central England.To the east of this, Caledonian structures trend north-west–south-east, but to the west and north the trend is north-east–south-west.A major feature of the palaeogeography of Britain during Early Carboniferous times is the land area of the Wales–Brabant Massif, formerly known as St George’s Land, which is, at least in part, a remnant of this Midlands Microcraton.\r\nMajor collision was taking place through Central Europe during the Early Carboniferous Subperiod as a result of closure of the Rheic Ocean, but to the north of this, in Britain, extensional tectonics prevailed.An overall north–south stretching is envisaged, although east–west tension has also been suggested.In England and Wales north of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the combination of (probable) north–south extension combined with the inherited Caledonian structures led to the development of asymmetric grabens with relative subsidence partly controlled by the position of low-density granite plutons.Rifting was pulsed, with particularly active episodes in Chadian–early Arundian and in mid–late Asbian times.Significant rifting also took place during Courceyan times.\r\nAreas undergoing slow subsidence and thus accommodating a relatively thin Lower Carboniferous succession have been variously called ‘blocks’, ‘highs’, ‘horsts’, ‘shelves’ or ‘platforms’, and the areas undergoing more rapid subsidence as ‘basins’, ‘troughs’, ‘gulfs’ or ‘lows’.\r\nSouth of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the Culm Trough and the shelf area bordering it are remnants of a back-arc basin relating to northwards subduction and closure of the Rheic Ocean.In Scotland, between the Grampian Mountains to the north and the Southern Uplands to the south, a major rift, the Midland Valley, formed, controlled by movements on inherited Caledonian faults.\r\nIn late Dinantian times, uplift of source areas led to southwards progradation of a giant clastic delta complex which rapidly filled the basinal areas.At this time, active rifting largely ceased and subsidence in Namurian and Westphalian times was regional and thermally driven.\r\nThe final closure of the Rheic Ocean led to the ‘Variscan’ or ‘Hercynian Orogeny’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>) during late Westphalian and Permian times.South of the Wales–Brabant Massif, compression resulted in thrust faulting and nappe emplacement.In northern Britain, inversion of Lower Carboniferous half-graben and subsequent erosion led to the development of a Permian–Carboniferous angular unconformity.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the Dinantian stratigraphy of Britain sites were selected according to palaeogeographically defined GCR Blocks.\r\n•\tDinantian of Scotland – Midland Valley Basin\r\n•\tDinantian of northern England and North Wales – Northumberland Trough; Lake District and Alston Blocks; Stainmore Basin and Askrigg Block; Craven Basin; Derbyshire Platform, North Staffordshire Basin and the Hathern Shelf; and North Wales Shelf;\r\n•\tDinantian of southern England and South Wales – South Wales–Mendip Shelf\r\n•\tDinantian of Devon and Cornwall\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nIn the early 20th century the first coral–brachiopod zonation schemes for the British Lower Carboniferous sequence were established; subsequently a proliferation of biostratigraphical schemes for the Lower Carboniferous successions of north-west Europe has evolved based principally on the distribution of miospores, conodonts, foraminifera and ammonoids.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of Somerset. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nSouth-West England, with its unglaciated granite landscapes, periglacial formations and raised beach deposits, is quite distinctive in its characteristics from, say, the Thames Valley, East Anglia or Scotland. Each of these regions offers a distinctive contribution to the overall picture of Quaternary landscapes and environments in Britain. A prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nThe themes and issues that form the focus of the Quaternary history and research in a given region primarily reflect the nature of the field evidence available. For example, South-West England, by virtue of its position mostly beyond the margins of the Pleistocene ice sheets, preserves an exceptional record of the long-term evolution of the British landscape. Likewise, Scotland is particularly noted for its assemblage of glacial landforms and ‘raised’ shorelines formed during the Devensian late-glacial.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question (e.g. granite landforms and periglacial features in South-West England); and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance, for example the tors of Dartmoor or the ‘raised’ beaches of Devon. Indeed, all the sites selected for the GCR Series are considered to be at least of national importance.\r\nFor Somerset, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tlong-term landscape evolution\r\n•\tPleistocene sea-level changes\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and deposits\r\n•\tkey sequences of deposits for interpreting the distinctive Quaternary history of the region\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of intrusive and extrusive igneous activity in the UK that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>), which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian (417–354 Ma) time.\r\nThere is at present no agreed definition of the term ‘Caledonian’, but is taken here to include all of the convergent tectonic and magmatic events arising from the closure of the ‘proto-Atlantic’ Iapetus Ocean in which many of the rocks of Late Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic age had been deposited. It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’. By this definition, most Caledonian igneous rocks of Britain range in age from about 500 Ma (earliest Ordovician) to around 390 Ma (end Early Devonian), with related activity continuing to around 360 Ma (end Late Devonian) in Orkney and Shetland.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and, by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, Baltica (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins.\r\nMagma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe exact sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is the subject of much debate, in which the distribution, nature and timing of the igneous activity are crucial evidence.\r\nThe tectonic history of the Caledonian Orogeny in Britain can be divided into the following time intervals, linking together coeval magmatic events in the various terranes across the whole orogenic belt.\r\n•\tEarly Ordovician –Tremadoc and Arenig\r\n•\tMid-Ordovician –Llanvirn and Llandeilo\r\n•\tLate Ordovician –Caradoc and Ashgill\r\n•\tEarly and mid-Silurian –Llandovery and Wenlock\r\n•\tLate Silurian and Early Devonian –Ludlow to Emsian\r\n•\tMid- and Late Devonian –Eifelian to Famennian\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nWithin this GCR Block, sites fall into natural ‘networks’, which are based upon petrological or tectonic affinites, age and geographical distribution. The ten networks are:\r\n•\tOrdovician Volcanic Rocks and Ophiolites of Scotland\r\n•\tOrdovician intrusions of the NE Grampian Highlands of Scotland\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of the Lake District\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of Central England\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of Wales\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: alkaline ntrusions of the NW highlands of Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: granitic intrusions of Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: northern England\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian volcanic rocks: Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian volcanic rocks: Wales\r\nSites that are important for unravelling the geological history of these major igneous events will also be important for demonstrating general processes of igneous rock petrology, magma evolution and emplacement, and vulcanology (e.g. Cauldron Subsidence theory at Glencoe) irrespective of their role in building up a picture of the sequence of events of geological history of the UK.\r\nWeighting of site selection has focussed on identifying those sites where the contribution of Caledonian igneous rocks of Great Britain to igneous petrology and the understanding of igneous processes and have played a major role in the initiation, testing and evolution of many theories of igneous processes.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 310 to 300 million years ago (Ma). This interval is part of Late Carboniferous Period (the Carboniferous Period spans from about 354 to 292 Ma). Underlying rocks formed during Namurian time (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=59' title='Click for details of GCR Block Namurian of England & Wales'>NAM-E-WL</a>).\r\nThere has been much confusion as to the exact meaning of the term ‘Upper Carboniferous’. In northern Europe, it has been taken to include all of the Namurian, Westphalian and Stephanian series, as this represents an interval of largely fluvio-deltaic clastic rocks, which can be readily separated from the mainly marine shelf limestones of the underlying Viséan. It is placed just above the base of the Chokierian Stage in the European classification. For convenience, the base of the Chokierian Stage is used in the GCR as an approximation to the lower limit of the Lower Carboniferous subsystem.\r\nNow, all of the eight stages of the Late Carboniferous Series, the Chokierian, Alportian, Kinderscoutian, Marsdenian, Yeadonian, Langsettian, Duckmantian and Bolsovian are defined by stratotypes in this country.  The Langsettian, Duckmantian and Bolsovian stages form the Westphalian Series.\r\nNamurian rocks in Britain can be roughly equated to the informal term ‘Millstone Grit’, which is overlain by the ‘Coal Measures’ and underlain by the Dinantian ‘Carboniferous Limestone’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nBritain has some of the best-exposed sequences of non-marine Upper Carboniferous strata anywhere in Europe. Nowhere else has such extensive coastal exposures of these beds, as can be seen in Pembrokeshire, Northumberland, Cumbria and Fife. Even outside of Europe, one would struggle to find comparable coastal exposures, at least within the palaeoequatorial belt, with the possible exception of Nova Scotia in Canada (e.g. Joggins Bank, Point Aconi). Britain also has many natural, inland exposures. In the Westphalian, South Wales stands unrivalled (at least in Europe) for its well exposed sequences of mainly non-marine, coal-bearing strata; for example, this is the only place to have a more or less continuously exposed section through the Langsettian, Duckmantian and Bolsovian strata (Cwm Gwrelych–Nant Llyn Fach).\r\nThere is considerable variation in the lithostratigraphical development of the Upper Carboniferous strata of Britain, and different areas often have their own set of formations. Only ‘the Productive Coal Formation’ (the mainly Westphalian, grey, coal-bearing deposits) has a reasonably wide distribution. However, there is an underlying pattern of lithofacies recognizable over much of the country, and this is recognized here as five groups listed as follows.\r\n•\tCulm Group\r\n•\tYoredale Group\r\n•\tMillstone Grit Group\r\n•\tPassage Group\r\n•\tCoal Measures Group\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe Upper Carboniferous of Britain was formed in an elongate belt of deposition lying between Poland and Ireland, that marks the contact-zone between the Gondwana and Laurasia continental plates. Originally separated by deep ocean (the ‘Proto-Tethys’), the Gondwana plate progressively drifted north relative to the Laurasia plate during Late Palaeozoic times. By Late Carboniferous time, the deep ocean had totally disappeared, and eventually the collision caused significant uplift and deformation of the Laurasian foreland. This tectonic episode is termed the ‘Variscan (or Hercynian) Orogeny’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>). However, between the times of ocean closure and basin inversion, a complex set of localized, synorogenic basins developed on the foreland.\r\nThere are four main mechanisms that have been proposed for how these basins were generated: (1) the northwards subduction of Gondwana under Laurasia, (2) transtension due to east–west mega-shear along the Gondwana-Laurasia plate boundary, (3) nappe loading due to the northwards migration of the Variscan front, and (4) north–south rifting and ocean spread due to the opening of a ‘Proto-Atlantic’ Ocean.\r\nThe result has been five discrete areas of deposition, separated by areas of non-deposition and sometimes erosion. These are, from south to north, Sabrina, the Wales–Brabant Barrier and the Southern Uplands Massif.\r\n(1)\tThe Culm Trough in south-west England. This was a shallow marine basin that was progressively filled during the Namurian by northerly derived deltaic sediments. Basin inversion and tectonic deformation here was rather earlier than in the rest of Britain, probably sometime in the middle part of the Westphalian Epoch.\r\n(2)\tThe Kent Coalfield, which is effectively a western extension of the Franco-Belgian Basin. This coalfield is known only through boreholes and underground mine workings, therefore as there is no exposure.\r\n(3)\tThe area immediately south of the Wales–Brabant Barrier, including principally South Wales, the Forest of Dean and the Bristol–Somerset coalfields. Like the Culm Trough, the Namurian strata are characterized by the progressive infill of a shallow marine basin by deltaic sediment, although it seems to have been ‘less marine’ than the Culm deposits. During the early and middle Westphalian times (up to the middle Bolsovian), deposition was characteristically in a fluvio-delatic regime, with extensive peat deposits. In late Westphalian times, however, uplift mainly to the south resulted in the influx of mainly arenaceous fluvial deposits (the Pennant Formation).\r\n(4)\tThe area between the Wales–Brabant Barrier and the Southern Uplands Massif, and including the northern English Midlands, the Pennines, and northern England. Again, the Namurian is characterized by mainly northerly-derived deltaic deposits filling a shallow marine basin, and the lower and middle Westphalian by fluvio-deltaic deposition. Unlike further south, however, there is no evidence of major fluvial deposits in upper Westphalian strata, except in the southern margins of the area. Instead, the progressive development of Variscan movement resulted in the formation of red beds such as the Etruria Formation.\r\n(5)\tThe Midland Valley of Scotland. The general facies development here is similar to the area south of the Southern Uplands Massif, with predominantly arenaceous deposits in the Namurian, coal-bearing deposits in the lower Westphalian and red beds in the upper Westphalian. However, marine influence was significantly reduced, with the result that marine bands are fewer and less well developed. Also volcanicity was a much greater influence, both as an influence on basin configuration, and on sedimentation itself (e.g. the Ayrshire Bauxitic Clay Formation).\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the Upper Carboniferous stratigraphy of Britain sites were selected according to palaeogeographically defined GCR networks\r\n•\tCulm Trough\r\n•\tSouth Wales\r\n•\tForest of Dean and Severn coalfields\r\n•\tBristol-Somerset Basin\r\n•\tEnglish Midlands\r\n•\tNorth Wales\r\n•\tMillstone Grit of the Central Province\r\n•\tCoal Measures of the Pennine Basin\r\n•\tNorthern England\r\n•\tScottish Basin\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=3' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arthropoda'>APD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=10' title='Click for details of GCR Block Carboniferous - Permian Fish/Amphibia'>C-P-FA</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=67' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeozoic Palaeobotany'>PAZ-PALBOT</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=66' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeoentomology'>PALENT</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology</h2>\r\nFive main groups of fossils have been used for biostratigraphical work in the British Upper Carboniferous strata: ammonoids (goniatites), conodonts, non-marine bivalves, microspores and plant macrofossils.\r\nMost stratigraphical correlations in the British Upper Carboniferous are based on biostratigraphical criteria. However, there are two types of ‘marker horizon’ available in these strata that provide valuable, abiotic means of establishing time-planes.\r\nThe most widely used are the marine bands. During the Late Carboniferous, Britain saw a progressive change from predominantly marine to predominantly non-marine conditions, and the preserved sedimentary sequence can be interpreted in terms of the interplay between these two broad environments.\r\nThe second type of ‘marker horizons’ consists of cineritic tonsteins, which were the result of volcanic ash-falls.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of Earth history that occurred as a result of the ‘Variscan Orogeny’, which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Devonian Period, which lasted from 417 to 354 million years ago (Ma) and continued through Carboniferous (354–292 Ma) time, as represented by geological features present in south-west England; geological structures of south Wales and the Mendips produced by the same events are covered by a separate GCR, for both geographical and geological reasons (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>).\r\nThe Variscan Orogeny occurred as a result of the northward convergence and collision of the continent of Gondwana (comprising South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica) with the southern margin of the stable continent of Laurasia (comprising North America, Europe and Asia). On collision, the supercontinent Pangaea was formed, being a single, huge landmass in the ocean Panthalassa. The Variscan Orogeny resulted in the formation of a mountain belt that included the Appalachians of eastern North America. The main orogenic belt associated with this collision was located far to the south of Great Britain in the Iberia–Armorica–Massif Central region. However, the northern limit of strong Variscan deformation, commonly known as the ‘Variscan Front’, migrated northwards during the orogeny and the final limit extends across southern Britain, between the Thames and Severn estuaries. To the north of this orogenic front, back-arc extension controlled structure, sedimentation and igneous activity in the British Isles throughout Late Devonian and Carboniferous times (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=11' title='Click for details of GCR Block Carboniferous - Permian Igneous'>C-P-IG</a>.).\r\nCornwall, or the Cornubian Massif, represents part of a trough into which sediments, eroded from the forming mountains, were accumulated. This trough, called the ‘North Variscan Foredeep’ would once have extended along the whole of the strike of the belt from Poland to western Ireland. Only small fragments are now exposed.\r\nDuring the final stages of continental collision, the sediments were folded and a large granite batholith was intruded into this trough, and cupolas of this granite are seen as the Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, St. Austell, Carnmenellis, Land’s End and Scilly Isles intrusions (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=37' title='Click for details of GCR Block Igneous Rocks of Southwest England'>IGN-SW-E</a>).\r\nThe Cornubian Massif also contains a feature highly typical of continent–continent collision, The Lizard Complex. This is a remnant of the old ocean that once existed between Gondwana and Laurasia (sometimes called the ‘Rheic Ocean’). Its emplacement and age are still not fully understood, but it was undoubtedly pushed North from the Variscan Suture Zone (which probably lay somewhere within what is now the Bay of Biscay) along a large-scale, major crustal thrust. The igneous rocks are encompassed within their own GCR Block, Igneous Rocks of South-West England. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=37' title='Click for details of GCR Block Igneous Rocks of Southwest England'>IGN-SW-E</a>.",

Strata laid down in the Devonian Period (the fourth Period of the Palaeozoic Era, 540–251 Ma) constitute the Devonian System.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography and palaeoenvironment</h2>\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=3' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arthropoda'>APD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=93' title='Click for details of GCR Block Silurian - Devonian Chordata'>SIL-DEV-CH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=67' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeozoic Palaeobotany'>PAZ-PALBOT</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=66' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeoentomology'>PALENT</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nIn the Devonian Period there are biostratigraphical zonal schemes for graptolites, ammonoids, brachiopods, fish, conodonts, microvertebrates and miospores.\r\nThe fossils that are present indicate that the Devonian Period saw profound changes in the evolutionary record, with the first significant colonisation of terrestrial habitats by vascular plants, the rapid expansion of the first aquatic vertebrates, and their emergence onto land.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 178 to 166 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first part of the Mid Jurassic Epoch, which spans from 178 to 157 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Mid Jurassic Epoch (part of the Jurassic Period) constitute the Middle Jurassic Series (part of the Jurassic System).\r\nThe Aalenian (178–174 Ma) and Bajocian (174–166 Ma) strata are included in one GCR Block together because they are commonly closely associated in general lithology – over much of southern England they approximately equate with the old stratal term, ‘Inferior Oolite’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nOn maps showing the solid geology of England, Middle Jurassic rocks crop out in an almost continuous strip from the Dorset coast to the North Yorkshire coast. In Scotland, Middle Jurassic rocks crop out in scattered patches in the islands to the north-west as well as in northern Scotland.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nDuring Early Jurassic times Britain was largely covered by shelf sea, however towards the end of the Epoch there was a significant fall in sea level accompanied by crustal upwarping and vulcanicity in the central North Sea Basin. Consequently, Middle Jurassic rocks reflect a variety of depositional environments including shallow marine, fluvial, deltaic, saltmarsh and coastal lagoon. In addition, limestone and clastic sedimentation (mudstone, siltstone and sandstone) was often widespread.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe many different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Mid Jurassic times mean that the fossil record is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). The brachiopods occurred in an abundance that was never repeated on such a scale in later geological times. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times; primitive mammals formed a minor but important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=3' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arthropoda'>APD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=38' title='Click for details of GCR Block Jurassic - Cretaceous Reptilia'>JUR-CRE-RP</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=48' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic Mammalia'>MES-MAM</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=49' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic Palaeobotany'>MES-PALBOT</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=58' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic - Tertiary Fish/Amphibia'>MZ-TR-FI-A</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=66' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeoentomology'>PALENT</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into five themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting, which was largely controlled by deep-seated structural features. The networks are:\r\n•\tWessex Basin\r\n•\tCleveland Basin (North Yorkshire sites)\r\n•\tEast Midlands shelf\r\n•\tWorcester Basin and Shelf (Cotswolds sites)\r\n•\tMoray Firth and Hebrides basins.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British ‘Portland beds’ and ‘Purbeck beds’ (uppermost Jurassic to Berriasian in age), strata that provide a geological record of Earth history from about 145 to 137 million years ago (Ma). This interval crosses the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary is the last Age (the Portlandian Age, 146 to 140 million years ago (Ma)) of the Late Jurassic Epoch (which itself spans from 157 to 140 Ma) and the first age (the Berriasian) of the Cretaceous Period (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>).\r\nThe geology of the local non-marine facies of the ‘Wealden’ (Early Cretaceous in age) is afforded its own GCR Block (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=104' title='Click for details of GCR Block Wealden'>WDN</a>).\r\nIn the British area the marine Portland beds (well exposed on the Isles of Portland and Purbeck) were deposited in a triangular area whose corners are Dorset, Oxfordshire and Sussex. They are mostly concealed under younger strata. The Portland Sand lies below the Portland Stone. The predominantly non-marine Purbeck beds, which occur in southern England only (fully exposed on the Isle of Purbeck) are limestones, marls and clays of lacustrine or lagoonal origin, and include palaeosols and marine intercalations.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=40' title='Click for details of GCR Block Kimmeridgian'>KIM</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary</h2>\r\nThe Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary is by definition that between the terminal Jurassic stage and the base of the first Cretaceous stage. The terminal Jurassic stage is again, by definition, the European Portlandian Stage. Eastwards from southwestern and southern Europe to the Crimea and beyond (i.e. in the Tethys biogeographical realm) the boundary lies among marine limestones. In the Boreal realm of Russia, Greenland and Canada, it lies within broken sequences of marine, clastic sediments. In Britain, Greenland, the north Atlantic and northern mainland of Europe there is a variety of latest Portlandian rocks containing related marine faunas.\r\nAcross much of Europe (parts of Iberia, Britain, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Jura, Russia), the latest Jurassic to early Cretaceous rocks (Portlandian-Berriasian) are often developed in non-marine ‘Purbeck’ and ‘Wealden’ facies. This has obstructed the search for unambiguous correlation and nomenclatural uniformity because the non-marine facies cut across the established marine ammonite-zoned stages of the latest Jurassic and Neocomian Series (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>). Additional complications were due to the deeper water facies in Tethys, extreme ammonite provincialism, belated general recognition and separation of the earliest marine Cretaceous strata from the late Jurassic and Valanginian succession and to the aggrandisement of a particular Portlandian facies to rival stage status (Tithonique/Tithonian). Erection of a ‘Purbeckian’ stage by Brogniart in 1829 further confused matters, but was not adopted by d’Orbigny, who saw the Purbecks as part of the Neocomian Series.\r\nAbandonment of the ‘Purbeckian’ and acceptance of the ‘Portlandian’ stage automatically defines the base of the first Cretaceous (Berriasian) stage and greatly simplify nomenclatural matters. In particular, the problem of placing the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary in the Portland-Purbeck-Wealden interval across northwest Europe is now approaching resolution but awaits only a final concensus on the selection of a basal ammonite zone for the Berriasian stage in Tethys.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology</h2>\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=40' title='Click for details of GCR Block Kimmeridgian'>KIM</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of East Anglia. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nSouth-West England, with its unglaciated granite landscapes, periglacial formations and raised beach deposits, is quite distinctive in its characteristics from, say, the Thames Valley, East Anglia or Scotland. Each of these regions offers a distinctive contribution to the overall picture of Quaternary landscapes and environments in Britain. A prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nFor East Anglia, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tlong-term landscape evolution\r\n•\tPleistocene sea-level changes\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and deposits\r\n•\tkey sequences of deposits for interpreting the distinctive Quaternary history of the region\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history as represented by continental ‘red bed’ sediments aged from about 291 to 210 million years (Ma) ago. The Permian Period (292–251 Ma) is the last period of the Palaeozoic Era (which spans from 540 to 251 Ma); the succeeding Triassic Period (251–205 Ma) is the first period of the Mesozoic Era (251–65 Ma); this Block does not encompass rocks of Rhaetian Age (the last age of the Triassic Period, 210–205 Ma), which are afforded their own GCR Block (see below). The British Permian and Triassic strata are included in one GCR Block together because they are commonly closely associated in general lithology – over much of England they approximately equate with the old stratal term, ‘New Red Sandstone’. (In the early 19th century, all red beds between the readily identifiable marine and coal-bearing Carboniferous and the marine Lower Jurassic strata were termed collectively the ‘New Red Sandstone’).\r\nMarine Permian GCR sites are selected for a separate Block. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=46' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Permian'>MAR-PER</a>. Therefore this GCR Block encompasses the broad range of desert environments of the Permian and Early to Mid Triassic deposits in Britain, as well as the brackish water to marginal marine environments of the Mid to Late Triassic times.\r\nAlthough the main focus of the Block is the Permian and Triassic continental sediments, sites of Rhaetian age – the marine Penarth Group (formerly called the ‘Rhaetic’, also of Triassic age) – are covered by a separate GCR Block. The Penarth Group sediments were laid down during a relatively short span of time at the end of the Triassic Period (only a few million years in duration) that provide a transition from the Triassic red beds into the marine Lower Jurassic Series (the ‘Lias’). See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=36' title='Click for details of GCR Block Hettangian, Sinemurian and Pliensbachian'>HET-PBN</a>. Owing to the formal definition of the base and top of the Rhaetian Stage, rocks of the uppermost part of the Mercia Mudstone Group, together with the and the lowermost part of the Lias Group are also classed as Rhaetian in age. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=91' title='Click for details of GCR Block Rhaetian'>RTN</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nDuring Permo-Triassic time, through plate tectonics, the continents moved together to form the supercontinent Pangaea (‘all Earth’), a single landmass that extended virtually from pole to pole, and which allowed animals to migrate unimpeded from what is now ‘Australia’ to what is now ‘Canada’. Later, towards the end of the Triassic Period, break-up of Pangaea began, and the incipient North Atlantic Ocean began to open up between what we now know as ‘Europe’ and ‘North Africa’ on the one side, and ‘North America’ on the other .\r\nThe Permo–Triassic basins of the western UK follow a roughly north–south linear rift system, the Clyde Belt, which was strongly influenced by the underlying structural grain. A number of different rift systems can be identified that contain a large number of individual basins, typically with a basin fill of 1–4 km of mostly continental red beds and evaporites. Major earth movements continued from Late Carboniferous into Early Permian times, particularly in the south of England. These earth movements, part of the Variscan or Hercynian phase of mountain building (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a>), resulted from Gondwana moving northwards against Laurasia. Suturing took place along a line within the current Mediterranean Sea, but the resultant north–south compression propagated northwards into southern England, Wales, and Ireland.\r\nThere were also immense changes in climates as well as in palaeogeography. The Permian Period began with a major glaciation in Gondwana (a southern hemisphere supercontinent that had fused with Laurasia to form Pangae). The glaciation began in the Carboniferous Period and came to an end during the Early Permian Epoch. Elsewhere, climates throughout the Permian and Triassic periods were generally hot, and conditions commonly arid. Indeed, much of the classic Permo–Triassic succession in Great Britain, and elsewhere, consists of ‘red beds’, sediments laid down in generally hot conditions either in deserts or in rivers and lakes, their predominant red-iron coloration attesting to the highly oxidizing environments in which they accumulated.\r\nPermian rocks occur widely in the British Isles, in a number of separate ancient depositional basins, from the Hebrides and west of Scotland, through the English Midlands, to Devon. In places, the successions are entirely continental, but in others there is a change from earlier, broadly continental, sedimentation, to later, broadly marine, deposition. There are also volcanic rocks of Permian age at some localities.\r\nThe Triassic succession of Great Britain is divided into a number of stratigraphical units that are generally hard to assign confidently to the Lower, Middle, and Upper Triassic divisions.\r\nThe upper boundary of the Triassic System is defined by the base of the Jurassic System, which is internationally recognized as being at the base of the planorbis subzone of the planorbis Ammonite Zone of the Hettangian Stage. The lowest few metres of the Lias, the ‘Pre-planorbis Beds’, are regarded as Triassic in age.\r\nThe classic terms ‘Bunter’ and ‘Keuper’ have been abandoned. Formations recognized in Triassic sequences in Britain constitute three major lithostratigraphical units, the Sherwood Sandstone Group, the Mercia Mudstone Group (largely equivalent to the old ‘Keuper Marl’), and the Penarth Group that are applicable throughout most of the British Isles.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThree main structural trends are recognizable from a map of the main Permo–Triassic basins in the UK: Variscan (east–west), Malvernoid (north–south), and Caledonoid (NE–SW). Broadly speaking these reflect the changing pattern from southern England to Scotland.\r\n1. Wessex and English Channel Basin System\r\nThe Wessex–Channel Basin System comprises a number of sub-basins: from south to north the Lyme Bay, Dorset, Wardour, and Pewsey basins, all with an overall east–west trend reflecting formation by extensional re-activation of Variscan compressional structures\r\n2. Worcester Basin and Severn–Bristol Channel Basin\r\nThe Worcester Basin is a north–south graben system bounded to the west by the East Malvern Fault/ Only youngest Triassic rocks are seen on the west Somerset and South Wales coastlines, bordering the Severn–Bristol Channel Basin, and in the Mendip Hills where some deposits are confined to fissures in the Carboniferous Limestones. In Glamorgan, marginal alluvial fans were sourced from ridges of Carboniferous Limestone and prograded southwards towards the Bristol Channel.\r\n3. East Midlands–Southern North Sea (SNS) Basin\r\nThe East Midlands shows little structure compared with the more westerly basins and the only syndepositional faults lie offshore.\r\n4. Cheshire Basin–East Irish Sea Basin\r\nThe Cheshire and East Irish Sea basins constitute part of the Clyde Belt, a NW–SE-trending chain of deep Triassic troughs stretching from the Highland Boundary Fault to the Cheshire Basin. The formation of these basins has been linked with an episode of extension associated with an early phase of Atlantic opening.\r\n5. Vale of Eden Basin\r\nThe Vale of Eden is a north–south-trending fault-bounded basin flanked to the east by Carboniferous and Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the Askrigg and Alston blocks.\r\n6. Southern Uplands\r\nIn the Southern Uplands of Scotland, Permian deposits rest unconformably on Lower Palaeozoic rocks in a series of basins with a mainly NNW–SSE trend, more or less normal to the regional Caledonian trend. This series of basins, which includes the Moffat, Dumfries, Thornhill, Stranraer, and Lochmaben basins, is similar to the north–south Carboniferous and Permian basin system that cuts the Mid North Sea High.\r\nThese basins are, like those in southern Britain, controlled by the structural grain of the basement rocks and are dissected by later faulting.\r\n7. Moray Firth\r\nThe Moray Firth Basin is a NE–SW-trending basin strongly controlled by the underlying Caledonian structural grain. There is a large array of faults that were re-activated during Mesozoic extension and that controlled the deposition .\r\n8. Minches Basin\r\nIn north-west Scotland are a number of Triassic basins that are mainly known from offshore wells and seismic exploration. These form the Hebrides–Sea of Hebrides–North Minch Basin, a NNE–SSW-trending complex controlled by major Caledonian faults. Outcrops of the Stornoway Formation on the islands of Mull, Skye, Raasay and Lewis occur within the basin.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block includes sites that were selected for the GCR because of their special significance in the study and understanding of British Permian and Triassic Red Bed stratigraphy, sedimentology, palaeogeography and palaeontology. Sites of scientific interest for their marine Permian rocks were afforded their own site selection category (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=46' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Permian'>MAR-PER</a>).\r\nBritish Permian and Triassic stratigraphical GCR networks are based on the sedimentary basins.\r\nPermian Strata\r\n•\tMoray Firth Basin\r\n•\tSouth-west Scotland\r\n•\tNorth-east England\r\n•\tWest Cumbria\r\n•\tVale of Eden\r\n•\tEnglish Midlands\r\n•\tDevon\r\nTriassic Strata.\r\n•\tMoray Firth Basin\r\n•\tWestern Highlands and Islands and Araran\r\n•\tWest Cumbria and the East Irish Sea Basin\r\n•\tCheshire Basin\r\n•\twestern margin of the North Sea Basin\r\n•\tCentral Midlands\r\n•\tSevern Basin\r\n•\tDevon\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived.  Sites of Permian and Triassic age important for fossils of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and arthropods were also selected independently for their own ‘Blocks’ in the GCR, owing to the relative rarity of fossils of this type. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=3' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arthropoda'>APD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=38' title='Click for details of GCR Block Jurassic - Cretaceous Reptilia'>JUR-CRE-RP</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=48' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic Mammalia'>MES-MAM</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=49' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic Palaeobotany'>MES-PALBOT</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=58' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic - Tertiary Fish/Amphibia'>MZ-TR-FI-A</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=66' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeoentomology'>PALENT</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nLife had flourished essentially unchallenged during the Carboniferous and Permian periods: crinoids, corals, nautiloids, ammonoids and fishes diversified in the seas, and amphibians and mammal-like reptiles continued their invasion of the land. However, after more than 100 million years of relative stability, the end of the Permian Period was marked by huge changes to the life of the time; these were far more devastating than the much more famous end-Cretaceous mass extinction when the dinosaurs died out.\r\nThe end-Permian mass extinction was by far the largest ever on Earth. Perhaps as many as 96% of all marine species became extinct, while on land more than three-quarters of all vertebrate families were lost; only 4% of known species survived through the event into the Triassic Period. This is the nearest that life on Earth has yet come to total annihilation.\r\nAlthough there is little fossil material in the red beds at the Permian–Triassic boundary in Britain that exemplify the impact on the fauna and flora, comparisons of the fossil record from marine Permian rocks and marine Triassic rocks reveal the extent of faunal changes. In the sea, reefs were destroyed, and with them disappeared the last of the rugose and tabulate corals, as well as major groups of bryozoans, echinoderms, foraminifera, ostracods, brachiopods, gastropods, bivalves, ammonoids, nautiloids, and fishes. This huge ‘clear-out’ of classic Palaeozoic animals opened the way for new groups of corals to arise later in the Triassic Period, and for previously minor groups of bryozoans, bivalves, echinoderms, and ammonoids to come to the fore.\r\nOn land too, the end-Permian mass extinction destroyed the complex ecosystems of amphibians and mammal-like reptiles, and left only remnants behind in the earliest Triassic times, from which arose the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, marine reptiles, and mammals. Some of these terrestrial forms appear sporadically in the fossil record, either as skeletal remains or as footprints in the British Permo–Triassic red beds, but the record is sparse.\r\nThe magnitude of the crisis is indicated by the recovery phase in the Triassic Period. Whole habitats had gone and took millions of years to return. For example, it took 20 million years before new kinds of reefs became re-established, being built, of course, by organisms different from those that built the Permian reefs. After the end-Permian event there is a famous ‘coal gap’, when no coal is found at all: the forests had been devastated, and burial of plant material in significant quantites came to a complete halt for 20 million years. The diverse and complex ecosystems of mammal-like reptiles, including massive, rhinoceros-sized plant-eaters, and sabre-toothed gorgonopsians that preyed on them, were gone, and only some small to medium-sized amphibians and reptiles inhabited the Early Triassic world. However, 30 Ma later, ecosystems had begun to diversify on land again, and this coincided with the radiation of the dinosaurs.\r\nThere was another planet-wide extinction event at the end of the Triassic Period, about 205 Ma ago, when many diverse groups of plants, animals, and microbes suffered unusually high levels of extinction.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 154 to 145 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the second part of the Late Jurassic Epoch, which spans from 157 to 140 Ma. The Kimmeridgian strata succeed Oxfordian Age rocks (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=63' title='Click for details of GCR Block Oxfordian'>OXF</a>) and is succeeded itself, in the GCR, by the Portlandian to Berriasian strata (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=90' title='Click for details of GCR Block Portlandian - Berriasian'>PTL-BER</a>). Rocks that formed during the Late Jurassic Epoch (part of the Jurassic Period) constitute the Upper Jurassic Series (part of the Jurassic System).\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nOn maps showing the solid geology of England, Upper Jurassic rocks crop out in an almost continuous strip from the Dorset coast to the North Yorkshire coast. In Scotland, Upper Jurassic rocks crop out in scattered patches in the islands to the north-west as well as in northern Scotland.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nTowards the end of the Mid Jurassic Epoch there was a significant marine transgression across much of Britain, drowning the varied shallow marine, fluvial, deltaic, saltmarsh and coastal lagoonal environments that had gone before. Thus, by the beginning of the Oxfordian Age, a shallow shelf sea was established over much of Britain. Sea levels rose throughout the Oxfordian Age and mudrock deposition was widespread, although limestones and sandstones of the ‘Corallian’ facies (near-shore or shallow water deposits) had developed by the end of early Oxfordian times. Mudrocks are also the predominant lithology of the Kimmeridgian strata, which represents a period of high, global sea level. After the Kimmeridgian there was a major fall in global sea level in Portlandian times, which led to re-emergence of certain land areas.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into five themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting largely controlled by deep-seated structural features. The networks are:\r\n•\tDorset to Oxford (Wessex Basin, and western margins of the ‘London Platform’)\r\n•\tEast Midlands (East Midlands Shelf)\r\n•\tNorth Yorkshire (Cleveland Basin)\r\n•\tScotland (Moray Firth and Hebrides basins)\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nInvertebrate faunas included abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). Corals became a significant part of the fauna where there was carbonate sedimentation, along with sponges, bryozoa, echinoids and gastropds. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and marine crocodiles. In addition, in Kimmeridgian times there were pterosaurs, ichthyosoars and turtles in the Kimmeridgian Age (trhe British Kimmeridge Cklay producing some of the best-preserved Late Jurassic marine reptiles ever found). The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times but in Britain the Upper Jurassic record is fully marine.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 545 to 495 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first period of the Palaeozoic Era, which spans from 545 to 251 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Cambrian Period constitute the Cambrian System.\r\nRocks that range across the Cambrian–Tremadoc boundary (the Tremadoc Epoch being the first of the Ordovician Period, 495–440 Ma) are afforded their own GCR Block (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=17' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian - Tremadoc'>CAM-TRE</a>), which includes a small number of sites.\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of Britain are essentially of marine origin; freshwater and subaerial deposits have been identified only in settings where volcanic edifices were raised above sea level.  Within the marine setting there are rocks of the widest variety, from sandstones and limestones of the shoreline and shallow shelves to beds that accumulated in deep basins or on the continental slopes.  Transects from shelf to basin are seen in both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and examples of shallow- and deep-water deposits are recognized in both Anglo-Welsh and Scottish areas.\r\nThe traditional series of the Ordovician System are Tremadoc (oldest), Arenig, Llanvirn, Caradoc and Ashgill (youngest).  There are no globally agreed divisions of the Cambrian System, although ‘Lower’, ‘Middle’ and ‘Upper’ are widely used, but not universally defined.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nCambrian: The largest Cambrian outcrops are in Wales, where they represent thick sedimentary accumulations that formed during an early phase of the development of the ‘Welsh Basin’ (see below). The best representation of the Cambrian System in the historical type area of North Wales is in the Harlech Dome, together with the similar sequence as exposed in the small but important outlying area of St Tudwal’s peninsula. In neither of these outcrops is the base of the Cambrian seen.  The Arfon area to the north-west presents a less-complete sequence that differs strikingly from that of the Harlech Dome. The contact with the Precambrian there has been claimed as both conformable and unconformable. The main area of Cambrian rocks in South Wales is in the west, around St David’s.\r\nIn northern Scotland the Cambrian strata of the ‘Hebridean Terrane’ crop out in a narrow belt nearly 200km long.  A small outcrop of possibl Cambrian rocks lies close to the Highland Boundary Fault Complex (part of the Highland Border Complex) farther to the south.\r\nOdovician: In North Wales there are outcrops of Tremadoc rocks important both historically and in relation to the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary.  In South Wales there are few outcrops of the Tremadoc and the strata are more akin to the thick successions of the Welsh Borderlands that extend across central England, where, however they are poorly exposed.\r\nIn North Wales, Arenig to Ashgill stratigraphy is dominated by successions reflecting a series of volcanic episodes, with the interfingering of sedimentary and volcanic units.\r\nThe Ordovician strata in the county of Shropshire appears in two main areas and adjoining parts of Wales. To the west of the Long Mynd horst, the lower half of the Ordovician succession is thickly developed in the Shelve area on the downthrown side of the Linley–Pontesford Fault. To the east, on the east side of the Church Stretton Fault, the classic Caradoc area exposes almost the whole of the Caradoc Series.  Apart from the Tremadoc strata, the Ordovician stratigarphy is little known over most of central England.\r\nIn the ocean-facing setting of northern England, Ordovician rocks crop out in the main Lake District Inlier and in the smaller Cross Fell, Cautley and Craven inliers, which are brought up along the Pennine, Dent and Craven fault systems.  In both the Lake District and Cross Fell the Skiddaw Group successions are followed unconformably by thick arc volcanic rocks, notably the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of possible late Llanvirn to early Caradoc age.  These are overlain, again unconformably, by marine sediments of mid-Caradoc age, and the fullest knowledge of the succession from the mid-Caradoc to the top of the Ashgill has been derived in this area by piecing together sections from various of the inliers.\r\nUnconnected with any other outcrop of the British Ordovician is the tiny exposure in south-west England at Gorran Haven in Cornwall.\r\nThe Ordovician of northern Scotland is present as part of the foreland sequence of the ‘Hebridean Terrane’ (see below), where it forms outliers on the Cambrian at Durness and Balnakeil, and also on the Island of Skye.  Nearly 200 km south-west of Macduff, at the northern edge of the ‘Midland Valley Terrane’, there are small outcrops of Ordovician rocks along the Highland Boundary Fault Complex from Arran to Stonehaven.  At the southern edge of the Midland Valley Terrane the celebrated Ordovician rocks of the Girvan district is a thick sequence deposited against and over scarps created by steeply dipping south-facing growth faults.  In the ‘Southern Uplands Terrane’ the Ordovician is mainly developed as a thick imbricated succession in the ‘Northern Belt’, but there are important faulted inliers in the ‘Central Belt’ to the south.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography and palaeoenvironment</h2>\r\nDuring the Cambrian Period, the microcontinent known as ‘Avalonia’, which includes the area of England and Wales, Belgium and northern Germany, together with south-east Newfoundland, New Brunswick and other parts of eastern maritime North America, lay far to the south of the equator.  It was effectively part of the huge continent of Gondwana at least until Arenig (the second stage of the Ordovician Period) times.  During the Ordovician Period, Avalonia migrated northwards to a temperate or sub-equatorial position and was first brought into proximity with the Baltic continent, ultimately to collide with the bulk of the North American continent, known as ‘Laurentia’.  As Avalonia moved from near polar latitudes to a subtropical position, its climate became modified, effecting changes in sedimentary and biotic environments that are duly reflected in the rocks and the fossils preserved in them. There is evidence from Africa and Arabia of an exceptional episode of glaciation at the end of the Ordovician Period  This caused a large, though temporary, fall in sea level and wrought great changes in the marine environment, which in turn brought about a major extinction in marine life.\r\nThroughout the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, Scotland lay in the tropics at the margin of Laurentia and during most of this time was separated from Avalonia by the wide ocean known as the Iapetus Ocean.  Scotland is made up of discrete fragments, or terranes, that were assembled progressively by strike–slip movements and were welded together during the collision of Laurentia with Avalonia and Baltica during the Caledonian Orogeny (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>). The early Palaeozoic history of Scotland is therefore very different from that of England and Wales, though during the later Ordovician the convergence of such features as fossil faunas is taken as evidence of the approach of England and Wales to Scotland as the Iapetus Ocean became narrower.\r\nThe complex plate-tectonic make-up of Britain has an important bearing on the character and distribution of Cambrian and Ordovician outcrops, because the early history of each tectonic terrane is more or less distinct.\r\nDuring Cambrian and early Ordovician time, most of Wales and England lay at passive plate margins.  Late Precambrian rifting initiated the Welsh Basin, whose infilling constituted the first of the megasequences, the ‘Dyfed Supergroup’. The onset of south-east-directed subduction during the early Ordovician saw the development in Wales of a back-arc basin with renewed sedimentation and abundant volcanic rocks.  These constitute a second megasequence, the ‘Gwynedd Supergroup’.  A third megasequence, the Powys Supergroup, commences in upper Ordovician (Ashgill) strata and extends up into the Devonian System.  The Welsh Basin, with its relatively thick sequences of basinal rocks, has the largest exposures of Cambrian and Ordovician rocks. The adjoining Midland Platform exposes thinner shelf sequences in a scattering of relatively small but stratigraphically and historically important inliers.  The passive ocean-facing margin in northern England accumulated thick clastic deposits in the earlier Ordovician (mainly Arenig), overlain by thick arc volcanics of about early Caradoc age.  A diachronous marine transgression followed, introducing relatively thin neritic deposits.  These include a full succession of the higher Caradoc and Ashgill series, in which many sites have been designated, and they form the base to a thick foreland basin succession deposited in the later Silurian.\r\nIn the Southern Uplands of Scotland there are thick developments of Ordovician rocks in a basin produced during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean.  Adjacent to these outcrops, but separated from them by the Southern Upland Fault, is the famous Girvan district, in which Ordovician successions show striking changes of thickness and facies.  The Highland Border area lies along a terrane boundary.  It is highly faulted and a uniform stratigraphy is elusive. The Hebridean Terrane in northern Scotland has a foreland margin succession that consists of relatively thin shelf deposits, mainly of Cambrian age.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nWhen originally selected, the Cambrian and Ordovician GCR sites were organized into stratigraphically thematic GCR Blocks that represented the following: the Cambrian System, the Cambrian–Tremadoc boundary, the Tremadoc Series, the Tremadoc–Arenig boundary, the Arenig to Llanvirn Series, the Llandeilo Series (now the Llandeilian Stage of the Llanvirn Series) and the Caradoc to Ashgill series. This arrangement emphasized the intervals of time represented but does bring together unrelated stratigraphical successions from different tectonic terranes and subdivides regional stratigraphical schemes. It is therefore possible to ascribe GCR sites to GCR networks based upon Cambrian and Ordovician terranes (i.e. frameworks derived from both space and time).  The Anglo-Welsh sites, commencing with the Cambrian System, are divisible into North Wales, South Wales and England.  The Ordovician System commences with the Tremadoc Series, including the main sites for the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary.  The Arenig to the Ashgill strata form a nearly continuous successions in Wales; three regions are represented: South Wales (including the Builth Inlier); North Wales; Shropshire and northern England.  Four structural terranes comprise the Cambrian and the Ordovician strata of Scotland.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology</h2>\r\nKnown life during the Cambrian and Ordovician was very largely confined to the marine realm. During this period of Earth’s history, life itself underwent two phases of evolutionary change of the utmost significance.  The early Cambrian was the time of the ‘Cambrian evolutionary explosion’, when a great variety of life-forms first appeared in the fossil record.  The resulting faunas, which included the first representatives of several groups of animals whose descendents exist today, formed the basis of the ‘Cambrian Fauna’. In the early Ordovician the Cambrian Fauna was largely replaced by the more diverse ‘Palaeozoic Fauna’ wherein a great variety of benthic, nektonic and planktonic organisms appeared, notably during an early to mid-Ordovician evolutionary radiation. Despite suffering a mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician Period, the Palaeozoic Fauna dominated the marine world for the next 250 Ma, the greater part of Phanerozoic history.\r\nBefore the end of the Ordovician Period there were marine faunas occupying environments from the intertidal zone to the deep ocean, and there is evidence from the mid-Ordovician for forays into the terrestrial realm.\r\nThe most striking faunal differences in the British Cambrian and Ordovician lie in the contrast between the Anglo-Welsh faunas and those of Scotland. Although this contrast, and the affinity of Scottish faunas with those of North America, had been recognized in the middle of the 19th century, it acquired great significance with the development of plate tectonic theory and the proposal of a ‘proto-Atlantic’ ocean, now generally termed the Iapetus Ocean. Generally speaking, Scottish faunas retained their North American similarities throughout the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. Meanwhile, the faunas of England and Wales, which had shown similarities to Gondwana during Cambrian to Arenig time, lost those connections to the south as the Rheic Ocean opened, and during the Caradoc and Ashgill they became more akin to the faunas of Baltica as the Tornquist Sea closed.\r\nIn the Cambrian Period the main components of the fossil fauna include brachiopods, trilobites, other arthropods such as bradoriids, gastropod-like molluscs, hyolithids, sponges, echinoderms and paraconodonts.  The Lower Cambrian faunas of ‘small shelly fossils’ also include many taxa of uncertain affinity.  Most of the foregoing groups also occur, and in greater diversity, in the Ordovician strata, with the addition of other molluscan groups, graptolites, euconodonts and chitinozoa, together with dasycladacean algae.  However, from rare instances of exceptional preservation of soft-bodied animals (of which the Canadian Burgess Shale is the most famous), we know that the fossils most commonly preserved represent only a small part of life of the time.  Besides ‘body fossils’ (i.e. the remains of actual organisms), Cambrian and Ordovician rocks commonly contain a variety of ‘trace fossils’, that is, tracks, trails, burrows and footprints, representing the activity of animals that may be, or more typically are not, themselves preserved.\r\nThe groups most widely used in British Cambrian and Ordovician stratigraphy are brachiopods, trilobites and graptolites.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Palaeozoic Palaeobotany GCR Block represent the British fossil record of vascular land plants during the Palaeozoic Era (which spanned from 540 to 230 million years ago (Ma)). This, the first 200 million years of land-plant history, was a time of major evolution and diversification of plants, as they adapted to, and radiated into, terrestrial habitats. At the end of the Permian Period (= end of Palaeozoic Era) a significant, global, mass extinction took place, enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a characteristic floral distinctiveness.\r\nLater fossil plants are afforded their own GCR Blocks, ‘Mesozoic Palaeobotany’ and ‘Tertiary Palaeobotany’. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=49' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic Palaeobotany'>MES-PALBOT</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=96' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Palaeobotany'>TER-PALBOT</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe Palaeozoic Era was a time of major evolution and diversification of plants, since most of the major morphological and anatomical strategies that allowed plants to take advantage of the terrestrial habitats appeared at this time as they adapted from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. The new habitats were not yet populated by animals, and were harsh and inhospitable. Nevertheless, from the earliest inter-tidal vegetation of the Silurian Period (425 million years ago), plants progressively became established on land, and eventually developed into the lush tropical wetland forests of the Late Carboniferous Period (300 million years ago). Towards the end of the Palaeozoic Era (250 million years ago), a traumatic episode beset land plants and many of the previously dominant forms became extinct. The emptying of the many ecological niches provided an opportunity for more advanced groups such as cycads and conifers to radiate in the Mesozoic Era, and marked the start of the development of a modern-style of vegetation.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe fossil plant material has been useful in palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions as an indicator of the geological past. The palaeogeography of each relevant geological period since the earliest terrestrial vegetation of the Silurian Period can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website.

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cenozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns.\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of South-West England. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nSouth-West England, with its unglaciated granite landscapes, periglacial formations and raised beach deposits, is quite distinctive in its characteristics from, say, the Thames Valley, East Anglia or Scotland. Each of these regions offers a distinctive contribution to the overall picture of Quaternary landscapes and environments in Britain. A prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nThe themes and issues that form the focus of the Quaternary history and research in a given region primarily reflect the nature of the field evidence available. For example, South-West England, by virtue of its position mostly beyond the margins of the Pleistocene ice sheets, preserves an exceptional record of the long-term evolution of the British landscape. Likewise, Scotland is particularly noted for its assemblage of glacial landforms and ‘raised’ shorelines formed during the Devensian late-glacial.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question (e.g. granite landforms and periglacial features in South-West England); and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance, for example the tors of Dartmoor or the ‘raised’ beaches of Devon. Indeed, all the sites selected for the GCR Series are considered to be at least of national importance.\r\nFor South-West England, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tlong-term landscape evolution\r\n•\tgranite landforms\r\n•\tPleistocene cave sequences\r\n•\tPleistocene sea-level changes\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and deposits\r\n•\tkey sequences of deposits for interpreting the distinctive Quaternary history of the region\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 184 to 178 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the last age of the Early Jurassic Epoch. Rocks that formed during the Early Jurassic Epoch (part of the Jurassic Period) constitute the Lower Jurassic Series (part of the Jurassic System).\r\nThe rocks deposited in the Toarcian Age constitute the Toacian Stage, which equates with the lithostratigraphically defined term ‘Upper Lias’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThe main outcrop of the Lower Jurassic Series in Britain forms an almost unbroken strip of varying width extending from the east Devon and the west Dorset coast, NNE through Somerset, Gloucestershire, the east Midlands and Humberside, to the coast of Cleveland and North Yorkshire. Significant outliers occur on either side of the Bristol Channel, in the Hebrides and adjacent west coast of Scotland, and in north-east Scotland, with others around Prees in Shropshire and Carlisle in southern Scotland.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nBritain lay between 30° and 40° north of the equator during early Jurassic times and occupied a key position in an epeiric seaway extending south-east into Tethys and north-east towards the Arctic. Although the break-up of Pangaea had commenced in Middle Triassic times, about 230 Ma, with rifting already well advanced by the start of the Jurassic Period, true ocean crust did not start forming in the north Atlantic until Toarcian times, about 180 Ma. Hence throughout early Jurassic times the major landmasses of North America and Greenland never lay far to the north and west, with further extensive areas of land present to the north-east in Scandinavia. These may have formed a source of some of the terrestrial elements of the biota, such as plants, insects and dinosaurs, which are found occasionally in these marine sediments, though many may have originated from the various minor islands which must have dotted this shallow seaway.\r\nIn a reconstruction of the palaeogeography during early Jurassic times published in 1992, it was considered that much of Scotland, the London Platform and the extreme south-west of England were land areas. The Mendip Hills and south-west Wales were considered to have been land for part of early Jurassic times but had become submerged by Toarcian times.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into three main themes or ‘networks’, reflecting regional setting, within which sites were selected to represent the lithostratigraphical formations. The networks are:\r\n•\tSouthern England and Wales\r\nBeacon Limestone Formation\r\nBridport Sand Formation\r\nMarlstone Rock Formation\r\n•\tNorthern England\r\nBlea Wyke Sandstone Formation\r\nWhitby Mudstone Formation\r\n•\tScotland (Hebrides Basin only)\r\nBearreraig Sandstone Formation\r\nPortree Shale Formation\r\nRaasay Ironstone Formation\r\nScalpay Sandstone Formation\r\nThe GCR sites selected include representatives from the main outcrop and from the main outliers, with the exception of the Carlisle and Prees outliers where there are no permanent exposures.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe many different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Early Jurassic times mean that the fossil record is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). The brachiopods occurred in an abundance that was never repeated on such a scale in later geological times. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times; primitive mammals formed a minor but important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Silurian-Devonian Chordata GCR Block represent the British fossil record of fishes of two periods in the middle of the Palaeozoic Era from about 438 to 355 million years ago (Ma); i.e. from the emergence of the fishes. At the end of the Devonian Period there was significant, global, mass extinction, enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a characteristic faunal distinctiveness from later assemblages.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe term ‘fishes’, unlike ‘mammals’ or ‘birds’ includes a range for aquatic vertebrates across several taxonomic classes. It refers to the living bony fishes (the teleosts) and cartilaginous sharks, rays and skates (the chondrichthyans), as well as a number of surviving representatives of older groups that were much more common in the past, such as the coelacanths, dipnoans (lungfishes), myxinoids (hagfishes) and petromyzontids (lampreys). The hagfishes and lampreys are jawless (agnathan) fishes. There are also two other groups of ‘fish-like’ aquatic chordates, which are not strictly ‘fishes’. These are the living lancelets (cephalochordates) and the extinct conodonts, which are both important for understanding fish evolution and are considered within this GCR Block.\r\nFollowing the appearance of fishes in Ordovician-Silurian times, when the group were entirely marine, non-marine environments are represented in British Devonian rocks. The Devonian Period had been unmistakably an ‘Age of Fishes’ with its proliferation of species in the marine realm and the entry into fresh waters on all continents.\r\nThe end-Devonian mass-extinction event involved the total demise of all the older groups of agnathans. Only the myxinoids (hagfishes), lampreys and most of the gnathostomes survived.\r\nAs well as displaying the evolution of fossil fishes during Silurian-Devonian times, Britain continues to yield invaluable material that helps eluidicate the origins and early evolution of tetrapods; the localities yielding important ‘Amphibia’ material are few in number, but are also globally rare. The first tetrapods entered the stratigraphical record in Late Devonian times; there are bones and teeth and their footprints from well before that period was ended.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe different depositional environments that developed in Britain during mid Palaeozoic times are summarised on the following pages:\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=86' title='Click for details of GCR Block Prídolí'>PRIDOL</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=105' title='Click for details of GCR Block Wenlock'>WEN</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into three principal themes or ‘networks’:\r\n•\tSilurian fossil fishes of Scotland\r\n•\tLate Silurian fossil fishes of the Welsh Borders\r\n•\tEarly Devonian fossil fishes of the Welsh Borders\r\n•\tEarly Devonian fossil fishes of Scotland\r\n•\tMid Devonian fossil fishes of Scotland\r\n•\tMid and Late Devonian fossil fishes of England and Wales\r\n•\tLate Devonian fossil fishes of Scotland\r\nWithin the overall rationale of the GCR, sites were assesed with the following weightings in mind:\r\n•\tsites of international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material.\r\n•\tsites yielding an assemblage (number and variety) of species that are signficant to the understanding of early vertebrates\r\n•\tsites where the fossils are exceptionally well preserved, showing features not seen elsewhere\r\n•\tbest-available sites for major fish/early tetrapod–amphibia assemblages necessary to represent evolutionary succession\r\n•\tsites with particular significance to science and history of palaeontology in the development of studies of early vertebrates\r\n•\tsites enabling the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the English and Welsh geological record of Earth history up to the beginning of the Palaeozoic Era, which began about 543 million years ago (Ma). ‘Precambrian’ is a broadly used term for rocks that pre-date the Cambrian Period, i.e. were formed before the Phanerozoic Eon. It encompasses such a vast span of time, extending back to at least 4000 Ma, and has been subdivided into two Eons, the Archaean and the younger Proterozoic Eon. The Precambrian rocks selected for this block belong to the latter, specifically to its youngest part, which has been given the chronological term ‘Neoproterozoic’.\r\nIn British rocks, the beginning of Cambrian time is commonly marked by a widespread unconformity, and also marked by what is often considered to be the onset of the appearance of small shelly fossils, which here therefore marks the end of the ‘Neoproterozoic’.\r\nScottish Precambrian rocks, which had a very different geological history have their own  GCR Blocks: Lewisian, Torridonian, Moine and Dalradian. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=43' title='Click for details of GCR Block Lewisian'>LEW</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=56' title='Click for details of GCR Block Moine'>MOINE</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=99' title='Click for details of GCR Block Torridonian'>TOR</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=25' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dalradian'>DAL</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThe Precambrian basement of England and Wales is exposed within a number of inliers, which are regarded as ‘windows’ through the cover strata. The rocks that are revealed are of considerable geological diversity. The Precambrian outcrops are sparsely distributed and generally occupy relatively small areas of southern Britain.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe Precambrian basement of southern Britain is most conveniently grouped into a number of large crustal entities, called ‘terranes’. Each terrane represents a microcosm of geological evolution and its rock assemblages may have arisen from a diversity of geological processes, commonly involving episodes of volcanism, igneous intrusion, sedimentation and deformation, all of which can be framed in the context of plate tectonic interactions. Each terrane represents views Precambrian rocks not as a single basement entity, but rather as belonging to a number of crustal fragments that together formed a late Precambrian microcontinent known as ‘Avalonia’. Many of these fragments initially evolved independently of each other and were subsequently joined together, forming a ‘collage’ of terranes. This terrane amalgamation took place along major tectonic boundaries that are now seen as wide shear zones or fault complexes. Although the terrane boundaries mostly date back to late Precambrian time, others possibly formed during younger orogenic events. Many terrane boundaries were also re-activated in the relatively recent geological past. the principal terranes are:\r\n•\tThe Charnwood Terrane\r\n•\tThe Wrekin Terrane\r\n•\tThe Cymru Terrane\r\n•\tMonian Composite Terrane\r\nThis series of 3 terranes, amalgamated into the network of GCR sites represents by far the largest exposure of Precambrian rock in southern Britain.\r\n•\tMonian Supergroup (‘Terrane 1’).\r\n•\tCoedana Terrane in central Anglesey (‘Terrane 2’)\r\n•\tAethwy Terrane exposed within a narrow linear belt in south-east Anglesey (‘Terrane 3’)\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the featured GCR sites are intended to show the broad spectrum of lithologies and geological processes representative of each terrane. Consequently, there are several themes or ‘networks’:\r\n•\tVolcanic sequences formed in a variety of tectonic settings\r\n•\tPlutonic igneous complexes\r\n•\tSedimentary and volcaniclastic strata ranging from deep-water marine to terrestrial environments\r\n•\tLow- to high-pressure metamorphic rocks\r\n•\tIntricate deformational structures\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=89' title='Click for details of GCR Block Precambrian Palaeontology'>PRE-PAL</a>.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British marine geological record of Earth history from about 142 to 121 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first part of the Early Cretaceous Epoch, which spans from 142 to 99 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Early Cretaceous Epoch (part of the Cretaceous Period) constitute the Lower Cretaceous Series (part of the Cretaceous System).\r\nThe geology of the local non-marine facies of the ‘Wealden’ is afforded its own GCR Block (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=104' title='Click for details of GCR Block Wealden'>WDN</a>); ‘Portland beds’ and ‘Purbeck beds’ (uppermost Jurassic to Berriasian age) are also afforded their own GCR Block that spans the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=90' title='Click for details of GCR Block Portlandian - Berriasian'>PTL-BER</a> for discussion).\r\nThe Berriasian (142–137 Ma) Valanginian (137–132 Ma), Hauterivian (132–127 Ma) and Barremian (127–121 Ma) strata, which constitute the Neocomian Series, are included in one GCR Block together because they are commonly closely associated in general lithology and palaeontology; these four stratigraphical stages precede the deposition of Aprian-Albian strata, rocks formed during the second part of the Early Cretaceous Epoch.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting, which was largely controlled by deep-seated structural features.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Cretaceous System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe British fossil record for the Berriasian–Barremian ages is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs were advanced; mammals formed a minor but increasingly important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

Rocks that formed during the Early Cretaceous Epoch (part of the Cretaceous Period) constitute the Lower Cretaceous Series (part of the Cretaceous System).\r\nThe Berriasian (142–137 Ma) Valanginian (137–132 Ma), Hauterivian (132–127 Ma) and Barremian (127–121 Ma) strata of marine origin, which constitute the Neocomian Series, are included in one GCR Block together because they are commonly closely associated in general lithology and palaeontology distinct from the non-marine Wealden strata (the Hastings Sands and Weald Clay); these four stratigraphical stages precede the deposition of Aprian-Albian strata, rocks formed during the second part of the Early Cretaceous Epoch.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 417 to 354 million years ago (Ma) as represented by non-marine rocks called the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ of Devonian Age. Old Red Sandstone strata of Prídolí (Silurian) age (419–417 Ma) are afforded their own GCR Block (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=86' title='Click for details of GCR Block Prídolí'>PRIDOL</a> and discussion below). Strata laid down in the Devonian Period (the fourth Period of the Palaeozoic Era, 540–251 Ma) constitute the Devonian System. Traditionally, the Old Red Sandstone rocks in Britain were regarded as wholly Devonian age, and as the terrestrial equivalents of the marine Devonian rocks of south-west England (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>). The age intervals, or stages, of the Devonian Period, defined in the marine rocks of continental Europe, can be applied to the terrestrial Old Red Sandstone succession, albeit with some difficulty because of its absence of marine fossils.\r\nIn the past, the base of the Old Red Sandstone was placed at the base of the Ludlow Bone Bed, a very thin, lenticular, phosphatised lag deposit present marking the top of the Silurian Ludlow Series in South Wales and the Welsh Borderland. However, the modern definition of the base of the Devonian System (in the Czech Republic, at the base of the Monograptus ultimus Biozone) now places the basal parts of the Old Red Sandstone succession in the Silurian System. The strata from the Ludlow Bone Bed up to the base of the Devonian, as yet poorly defined in the Old Red Sandstone, belong to the Pridoli Series, the fourth, uppermost series of the Silurian System see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=86' title='Click for details of GCR Block Prídolí'>PRIDOL</a>.\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone is one of the two major red-bed sedimentary unit in Great Britain, the other being the younger Permo-Triassic rift basin-fill, formerly termed the ‘New Red Sandstone’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=70' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic'>PER-TRI</a>) to distinguish it from the Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone rocks crop out principally in four main areas in Great Britain, which broadly reflect the original basins in which they were deposited. These are: the Orkney and Shetland islands and north-east Scotland (the Orcadian Basin); the Midland Valley of Scotland (in an amalgamation of several basins of which the largest was the Strathmore Basin); Northumberland (the Northumberland and Solway basins); and south Wales and the Welsh borderland (the Anglo-Welsh Basin).\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography and palaeoenvironment</h2>\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone represents a period when ocean closure and continental collisions resulted in a world geography hugely different to that of much of the early part of the Palaeozoic Era. The Iapetus Ocean, which separated the northern (Laurentian) and southern (Gondwana) continents during the Ordovician Period closed throughout the Silurian Period as the smaller continent of Avalonia fragmented from Gondwana and drifted northwards. As the Iapetus Ocean closed north of Avalonia, the Rheic Ocean opened behind it. To the east, the continent of Baltica also drifted northwards and eastwards and the Tornquist Sea, an arm of the Iapetus between it and Laurentia, slowly closed. Baltica and the eastern part of Avalonia collided first, in Late Ordovician time, moving northwards together to make first contact with Laurentia in the early part of the Silurian Period. By late Silurian (Ludlow) time, the continents had fully docked, with the Iapetus Ocean closed along the line of subduction (the Iapetus Suture) under the Southern Uplands. Thus, the Caledonian–Appalachian Orogen and the newly amalgamated Old Red Sandstone continent (also named Laurussia and Euramerica) was formed (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>). Palaeogeographic reconstructions suggest that the continent lay in tropical to sub-tropical latitudes from the equator to about 30ºS. Sedimentological studies of the Old Red Sandstone indicate a warm to hot, tropical setting with rainfall confined to wet seasons. Uplift of the orogen may have caused broad variations in the rainfall pattern, producing periods of wetter and drier climate.\r\nContinuing compression and shortening of the continental crust resulted in the filling to sea level of the Silurian basins, their inversion to upland areas and the establishment of terrestrial conditions in newly developing basins. The oblique angle of  impingement of the former Laurentian and East Avalonian continents resulted in sinistral transpressive movement, thrusting along major NE-trending faults, and granitic intrusion, andesitic volcanicity and low-grade metamorphism in northern Britain. The compression in the Laurentian crust, of which the Scottish Highlands were part, was accompanied by the intrusion of large volumes of granitic rocks and the extrusion of predominantly andesitic volcanic rocks (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=62' title='Click for details of GCR Block Old Red Sandstone Igneous'>ORS-IGN</a>).\r\nThe Orcadian Basin was a large mid-Devonian intramontane lake basin, totally unconnected to the open sea, apart perhaps from a brief period. The Midland Valley of Scotland was not a single discrete basin in the Devonian. Weakened by a long history of igneous activity, internal, transtensional fault movements opened pull-apart basins and transpressive movements subsequently inverted them, resulting in the recycling of the basin-fills and providing weak points for continuing volcanic extrusion. The preserved sequences thus represent the deposits of separate pull-apart basins, formed and brought together in a strike-slip faulted collage. The Stonehaven Basin in the north-east is the earliest, its fill dating perhaps from the Wenlock Epoch. It and its larger successor basins, the Crawton and Strathmore basins, formed by sinistral strike-slip along the Highland Boundary Fault. The southerly Lanark Basin formed along the Southern Uplands Fault. Large volumes of arc-related volcanic rocks were extruded along the central axis of the Midland Valley, on lines weakened by the transtensional stresses. The late Silurian to early Devonian Solway and Northumberland basins formed in the Southern Uplands Terrane and were probably isolated from the basins of the Midland Valley to the north. The late Devonian Scottish Borders Basin formed after Acadian inversion in the mid-Devonian and extended into the Midland Valley.\r\nThe Anglo-Welsh Basin is interpreted primarily as the product of load-generated flexural subsidence of the Caledonian foreland. Superimposed on this were transtensional and extensional movement on faults that produced variations in the basin fill in Pembrokeshire and introduced coarse clastic detritus farther north. The isolated succession in Anglesey was probably deposited contiguously with the Přídolí sequences to the south, although the initial coarse conglomerates are unique and of local derivation, and lacustrine deposits suggest internal or impeded drainage; the effect of the nearby Caledonoid faults requires examination.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe four networks covered by this GCR Block are essentially the four main outcrops of the Old Red Sandstone, arranged geographically from north to south, and which correspond to, or closely reflect, the original depositional basins.\r\n•\tOrcadian Basin\r\n•\tMidland valley of Scotland\r\n•\tNorthumberland and Solay basins\r\n•\tAnglo-Welsh Basin\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=3' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arthropoda'>APD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=93' title='Click for details of GCR Block Silurian - Devonian Chordata'>SIL-DEV-CH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=67' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeozoic Palaeobotany'>PAZ-PALBOT</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=66' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeoentomology'>PALENT</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nIn the Devonian Period there are biostratigraphical zonal schemes for graptolites, ammonoids, brachiopods, fish, conodonts, microvertebrates and miospores.\r\nThe problems of classification and correlation of the Old Red Sandstone of Britain are inherent in its terrestrial origins and the patchy preservation of its non-marine fossils.\r\nThe fossils that are present indicate that the Devonian Period saw profound changes in the evolutionary record, with the first significant colonisation of terrestrial habitats by vascular plants, the rapid expansion of the first aquatic vertebrates, and their emergence onto land.  However, no direct correlations can be made with the European marine successions and the internationally agreed stages. Because of this, a series of loosely defined local stages (Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian and Farlovian) were erected for the Anglo-Welsh Basin. Although now largely subsumed into the international stages as a result of increasing refinement in correlation, they continue to be used as a matter of convenience in describing the Anglo-Welsh succession.\r\nThe principal macrofossils of stratigraphical use are fish fragments. Miospore classifications and microvertebrate classification also aid correlation and stratigraphical resolution.",

    "Name": "Coastal Geomorphology of England",
    "Description": "This GCR Block encompasses coastal landforms and geomorphology as developed in England. Many factors interplay to create the changing face of the coast that we see today: geology, glaciation, sea-level change, sediment supply, wind, wave, tide, and, increasingly, human activities.\r\nOne of the characteristics of the coastline of Great Britain is its state of continual change. Such geomorphological change may be slow and gradual, such as that which occurs where the geological inheritance has produced a resistant rocky coast, or it may also be extremely rapid, such as the almost instantaneous erosional impact of storm waves on a sand beach\r\n\r\n<h2>The geological background</h2>\r\nThe pattern of geological outcrops along the British coast has a fundamental control on the character of the coastline. Broad connections between outcrop pattern and the outline of the coast can be traced, and local geological variations control the detailed pattern of coastal form at local levels. Thus while there are differences between the older and generally far more resistant rocks of northern and western Britain and the younger and weaker rocks found in east and southern England, within each of these zones local contrasts dominate the coastal geomorphology. From Flamborough Head in Yorkshire southwards and westwards to the Exe estuary in Devon, the Chalk and sandstones that form the cuestas of the scarpland and vale landscape also form the major coastal headlands (Flamborough Head, North Foreland in Kent, Beachy Head in Sussex, and the Needles on the Isle of Wight, for example, all on Chalk) and between them on the intervening clays or on till-covered littoral plateaux, wide bays, locally fronted by saltmarshes and sand dunes, alternate with low cliffs cut into the low till-capped plateaux of Holderness, Norfolk and Suffolk.\r\n\r\n<h2>Geological influence on sediment supply into the coastal system</h2>\r\nA further influence of geology on coastal geomorphology is in the provision of sediment – from offshore as well as from retreating cliffs – that can be incorporated into beaches. Boulders and coarse gravel are derived from erosion of resistant rocks in areas such as Scotland and parts of the Welsh coast; flints form the commonest pebbles and cobbles on beaches in the south of England. Many ‘shingle’ (gravel) beaches have been built from offshore gravels, swept ashore as sea level rose during the Holocene marine transgression, and former sea-floor sediment has contributed to many beaches elsewhere. In places, flints are derived from erosion of the Chalk in which they occur. Farther north in England, a large proportion of the gravel has been eroded from glacial gravels and till cropping out along the coast or offshore.\r\nIn Scotland and Wales, by far the greatest source of gravel and sediment has been derived from glaciogenic sources, deposited both inland and on the adjacent shelf by either glaciers or glacial meltwater. As a result, the sediments are as varied as the rocks that were originally eroded by ice.\r\nSome coarse sediments are brought to the coast by rivers, especially in Scotland and Wales, where gradients are steep and coarse-grained material is readily transported by floods. In contrast, very little sediment other than mud (clay and silt) is now brought down the rivers of lowland Britain to the coast.\r\n\r\n<h2>The coastal marine environment: tides, waves, surges and currents</h2>\r\nIn global terms, the British Isles have unusually high tides and unusually stormy conditions; thus they have a very dynamic coast, one of the reasons why British coastal research has made such an important contribution to the world literature.\r\nHowever, each of these influences also varies greatly around Great Britain. Tidal range is highest at the head of inlets such as the Bristol Channel, and lowest on the English Channel coast between Start Point and Portsmouth, on the East Anglian coast within the North Sea, Cardigan Bay in Wales, and in Shetland in Scotland. Wave energy is highest on coasts exposed to the strong winds of western Britain and the North Atlantic swell; it is lower in such relatively sheltered areas as the Irish Sea and the North Sea. Given its western exposure to the Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel coast tends to fall into an intermediate category.\r\nBoth tidal movements and the advance of waves into shallow water create currents and these move sediment in the nearshore zone, shaping sandbanks, which in turn can affect the local conditions, for example, by forcing larger waves to break and so lose energy as they touch bottom on submerged banks, or even to break against them at low tide. In constricted bedrock channels, perhaps the best example is the Pentland Firth, the tides create extremely strong currents, and where they are channelled between sandbanks as in the Thames estuary or off Great Yarmouth, the patterns of ebb and flow (often dominating different channels) run much faster than in the open sea.\r\nTidal range has an effect on coastal landforms. Barrier beaches, behind which saltmarshes form, tend to be restricted to areas with relatively low tidal range, such as the north Norfolk coast. Such areas also have spits, which in some cases grow to many kilometres in length, for example, Blakeney Point and Orfordness.\r\nHigh tidal-ranges can occur towards the head of estuaries (or Firths in Scotland), and here saltmarshes also develop, though compared with areas of low tidal range they are generally steeper and show much stronger zonation of vegetation, such as in the Bristol Channel–Severn estuary.\r\nThe waves reaching the coast are mainly generated by winds offshore. In the case of the semi-enclosed seas of the Irish Sea and the North Sea, most waves are generated by winds blowing across relatively restricted fetches, and so have a short wave-length, short period, and are relatively steep. Thus along the coasts of these seas, the varying pattern of length of fetch is an important control over wave energies from all directions offshore as well as the frequency with which winds blow from any one direction.\r\nIn the North Sea waves from a northerly direction are generally the largest, with a secondary maximum in East Anglia for waves from the south-east. In the Irish Sea, a west-facing beach like Blackpool, Lancashire, gets its largest waves from a westerly direction, but these are always short-period waves and so put rather small volumes of water onto the beach as they break. As a result, the wide, sandy beach at Blackpool generally consists of a series of ridges and intervening runnels; the seaward slopes of the ridges may be in equilibrium with the short-period waves.\r\nLocally on the North Sea coast, ridge-and-runnel beaches are found in the shelter of a headland, limiting waves reaching the beach to those from the east or south-east; an example is in Bridlington Bay, which is protected from the larger northerly waves by Flamborough Head, Yorkshire.\r\nOn those parts of coast exposed to North Atlantic storm and swell waves, energies are much higher and the long-period waves put large volumes of water onto the beach as they break. Thus such wave conditions often produce very wide beaches with a gentle slope, for example Rhossili in South Wales, the beaches of the Western Isles and in some of the more exposed Cornish bays. Where strong regional winds build large waves, energies are very high, but it is also possible for long-period swell generated far offshore, even in the South Atlantic, to reach the western beaches. Such swell loses height as it moves across the ocean, but it can be distinguished by its typically long period. Beaches exposed to the Atlantic Ocean tend to be dominated by the high energies associated with longperiod waves, even where the exposure is indirect and the waves reach the coast after refraction.\r\nHigh wave-energies can cause considerable erosion even of resistant rocks, and will exploit structural weaknesses such as faults, joints and bedding planes. Narrow inlets, caves, stacks and natural arches are found along our higher-energy coasts even in the most resistant rocks. Good examples of such forms, eroded into resistant lithologies, are found almost everywhere on the islands of the St Kilda group and in the Shetland Islands, such as Foula and Papa Stour. They can also be found in weaker rocks where wave energies are lower, for example, the Chalk cliffs of Thanet, Kent. Waves are also responsible for the longshore drift of sediment along the coast.\r\n\r\n<h2>Coastal sediment transport</h2>\r\nThe alongshore transport of sediment (littoral or longshore drift) is achieved by waves and the currents they induce within the breaker zone. In England particularly, the widespread construction of groynes, revetments and walls has interfered with coastal sediment movement and the coastal sediment balance.\r\nThe direction is determined largely by the angle of wave approach, i.e. it is related to the dominant fetch. Thus the general direction of transport is southwards on the eastern coast of England, and eastwards on the Channel coast.\r\nIn the northern North Sea, the pattern is westward movement along the Moray Firth and mainly southward movement along the Aberdeenshire and Angus coast. The pattern around the Irish Sea is a little more complicated since it is not open to the north as is the North Sea.\r\n\r\n<h2>Sea-Level History</h2>\r\nAt the time of the last glacial maximum, some 18 000 years ago, the abstraction of water from the oceans to build the great land-based ice caps reduced global sea level to some 120–140 m below that of the present day.By the beginning of the Holocene Epoch, 10 000 years before present (BP), sea level was some 40 m below present, and as it continued to rise (the Holocene marine transgression) was within 10 m of its present stand at about 5000 years ago, and close to present level by 4000 years BP. However, the precise changes at any one site will depart from this pattern for many reasons, including crustal stability (tectonic changes, the effects of loading or removal of load by ice sheets and the oceans themselves, local sedimentation) and tidal changes as the coastal configuration has changed, as well as many other lesser effects that may lead to local departures from the general pattern of sea-level rise.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe GCR site-selection exercise for coastal geomorphology followed four categories (‘GCR Blocks’), one for each of England, Scotland and Wales and one for ‘Saltmarsh Geomorphology’; although three of the ‘Blocks’ are country based, comparisons were made to ensure that certain types of site occurring in each were not over-represented in a Great Britain-wide context.\r\nIn some cases, ‘representative’ sites were selected for the GCR as part of a group of related sites. Such a group of sites may show different aspects of one type of phenomenon, which shows significant regional variations in its characteristics, for example, sites with similar landforms have been selected from areas having different tidal ranges.\r\nMost of the GCR sites are dominated by one coastal landform, especially in terms of their associated research significance. However, the selected GCR sites include a number that are complex in their assemblage of linked geomorphological forms, and so they have been classified as ‘Coastal Assemblages’.\r\nThe geomorphology of the coastline is controlled by a complex interaction of factors – the dynamics of the coastal ‘cell’, geological controls (e.g. rock type and structures), the Pleistocene inheritance (isostatic and eustatic effects), sediment ‘budget’, tidal regimes as well as anthropogenic influence. It is the intention within the ‘representativeness’ rationale of the GCR to be able to demonstrate the interplay of these themes and their manifestations from the evidence present in the selected GCR sites. These themes can be thought of as providing a basis for GCR Networks, which link clusters of representative sites.\r\nUltimately, some 26 networks were identified for the GCR project.\r\nA. Cliffed coasts\r\n1. Large-scale structural control: longitudinal and transverse coasts\r\n2. Small-scale structural control: caves, arches, stacks, geos, zawns\r\n3. Cliff forms and processes: plunging cliffs, slope-over-wall, hog’s back, variety of rates of cliff retreat, differential erosion\r\n4. Exhumed and emerged forms: cliffs, benches\r\n5. Karstic development\r\nB. Shore platforms (including both contemporary and emerged features)\r\n6. Structurally controlled\r\n7. Erosionally dominated\r\nC. Beaches and intertidal sediments\r\n8. Beach orientation: relation to wave direction, swell-dominated beaches\r\n9. Beaches undergoing erosion\r\n10. Prograding beaches\r\n11. Beach phases\r\n12. Pre-existing sediment sources, including pre-existing clasts\r\n13. Emerged (‘raised’) beaches\r\n14. Cliff-foot beaches\r\n15. Dunes: rock-based, gravel-based, restricted sources, sand plains\r\n16. Spits\r\n17. Barrier beaches\r\n18. Cuspate forelands and nesses\r\n19. Tombolos and tied islands\r\n20. Intertidal sediments\r\n21. Mudflats, ridge and runnel forms\r\n22. Saltmarsh morphology – creeks, saltpans, piping\r\n23. Machair\r\nD. Coastal valleys\r\n24. Chines, truncated valleys, coastal waterfalls\r\nE. Inlets and submerged coasts\r\n25. Fjords, rias, estuaries\r\nF. Semi-enclosed bays\r\n26. Restricted sediment sources and transfers, submarine barriers, sediment sorting\r\nClearly, any one site may be helpful in elucidating several of these themes and therefore may contribute to more than one GCR Network (for example, Culbin, on the Moray Firth, provides information on sea-level change as well as gravel delivery data over the Holocene Epoch at a site characterized by well-developed dunes situated on top of spit structures).\r\nThe GCR sites encompassed by this GCR Block exclude major coastal landslides, such as Folkestone Warren; which are covered by the Mass Movements GCR Block.Also, sites that are of interest for coastal features that are particularly important for elucidating the Pleistocene history of Britain are described in the Quaternary GCR Blocks.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of the Midlands-Avon area of England. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nA prime aim of site selection was to reflect the regional diversity of Quaternary features and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nFor the Midlands-Avon area, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tlong-term landscape evolution\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and deposits\r\n•\tkey sequences of deposits for interpreting the distinctive Quaternary history of the region",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from around 460 to 458 million years ago (Ma). Originally afforded ‘Series’ status at the time of GCR site selection, the Llandeilo rocks now comprise the Llandeilian Stage of the Llanvirn Series. Rocks formed during the Llanvirn Epoch comprise the Llanvirn Series.  The Llanvirn Epoch is the third of the Ordovician Period (495–440 Ma), which is the second period of the Palaeozoic Era (545 to 251 Ma). Rocks that formed during the Ordovician Period constitute the Ordovician System. Arenig–Llanvirn (excluding ‘Llandeilo’) sites have their own GCR Block. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>.\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of Britain are essentially of marine origin; freshwater and subaerial deposits have been identified only in settings where volcanic edifices were raised above sea level.  Within the marine setting there are rocks of the widest variety, from sandstones and limestones of the shoreline and shallow shelves to beds that accumulated in deep basins or on the continental slopes. Transects from shelf to basin are seen in both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and examples of shallow- and deep-water deposits are recognized in both Anglo-Welsh and Scottish areas.\r\nThe traditional series of the Ordovician System are Tremadoc (oldest), Arenig, Llanvirn, Caradoc and Ashgill (youngest).\r\nFor details of Ordovician stratigraphy, palaeogeography, palaeontology and GCR site selection, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=16' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian'>CAM</a>.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of Cumbria. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nSouth-West England, with its unglaciated granite landscapes, periglacial formations and raised beach deposits, is quite distinctive in its characteristics from, say, the Thames Valley, East Anglia or Scotland. Each of these regions offers a distinctive contribution to the overall picture of Quaternary landscapes and environments in Britain. A prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nThe themes and issues that form the focus of the Quaternary history and research in a given region primarily reflect the nature of the field evidence available. For example, South-West England, by virtue of its position mostly beyond the margins of the Pleistocene ice sheets, preserves an exceptional record of the long-term evolution of the British landscape. Likewise, Scotland is particularly noted for its assemblage of glacial landforms and ‘raised’ shorelines formed during the Devensian late-glacial.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nFor Cumbria, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tthe pre-Devensian glacial and interglacial record\r\n•\tthe Devensian glacial record\r\n•\tThe Late-glacial record\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and slope deposits\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "This GCR Block encompasses the British volcanic rocks and associated intrusions that were emplaced north of the Variscan Front (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>) during the Carboniferous and Permian periods (from about 354 to 251 million years ago (Ma)). At this time the geological basement of Great Britain was part of the supercontinent of Pangaea, which was drifting slowly northwards through tropical latitudes, sequentially developing semi-arid river flood-plains, shallow tropical seas with carbonate reefs, thickly vegetated coastal deltas with coal-forming swamps and finally, deserts (for details of stratigraphy see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=26' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Devon & Cornwall'>DIN-DV-CW</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=27' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Northern England & North Wales'>DIN-N-E-WL</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=29' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Scotland'>DIN-SC</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=46' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Permian'>MAR-PER</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=59' title='Click for details of GCR Block Namurian of England & Wales'>NAM-E-WL</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=70' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic'>PER-TRI</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=106' title='Click for details of GCR Block Westphalian'>WPH</a>). Stretching and thinning of the Earth’s outer layers, well to the north of the nearest zone of continental collision, facilitated melting of the underlying mantle. Rifting provided weaknesses along which the resulting magmas could reach the surface or near-surface and volcanoes erupted across the wide range of geographical and climatic settings. Their products are dominantly basaltic but during Early Carboniferous time in central Scotland, the ascent of the magmas was interrupted locally, allowing a wide range of more-evolved compositions to form.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThe Carboniferous and Permian igneous rocks are widely scattered along the length of Great Britain, from the Bristol Channel in the south to the Orkney Islands in the north.By far the greatest concentration of outcrops is in and around the Midland Valley of Scotland, with significant but less extensive outcrops around the Solway Firth, along the England–Scotland border, and in Derbyshire. Small outcrops occur in the West Midlands of England, in the western Mendip Hills and in south-east Wales). In addition, a concealed widespread volcanic field underlies younger rocks in the East Midlands, a sill-complex crops out and extends beneath a large area of north-east England and dyke swarms extend across parts of the Highlands of Scotland.Igneous rocks to the south of the Variscan Front, that is, south of the Mendip Hills, are included in the Igneous Rocks of South-West England GCR Block. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=37' title='Click for details of GCR Block Igneous Rocks of Southwest England'>IGN-SW-E</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nFollowing the end of the Caledonian Orogeny, in Late Devonian time (c. 370 Ma), the area of continental crust that now makes up the British Isles was part of the supercontinent of Laurussia (informally known as the ‘Old Red Sandstone Continent’). This had formed during the orogeny by the amalgamation of several pre-existing continents. The crust of Scotland and the far north-east of England had lain on the margin of the continent of Laurentia, which included Greenland and most of North America, whereas England and Wales were part of the microcontinent of Avalonia. The junction between these two plates, now concealed beneath younger rocks, is called the ‘Iapetus Suture’ and trends approximately north-east from the Solway Firth to the coast of Northumberland, around Seahouses .\r\nFrom Late Devonian times onwards, the southern continent of Gondwana was in collision with the southern margin of Laurussia, leading to the Variscan Orogeny, and creating the supercontinent of Pangaea. The main orogenic belt associated with this collision was located far to the south of Great Britain in the Iberia–Armorica–Massif Central region. However, the northern limit of strong Variscan deformation, commonly known as the ‘Variscan Front’, migrated northwards during the orogeny and the final limit extends across southern Britain, between the Thames and Severn estuaries. To the north of this orogenic front, back-arc extension controlled structure, sedimentation and igneous activity in the British Isles throughout Late Devonian and Carboniferous times.\r\nFive main sedimentary depositional ‘provinces’, separated from each other by important palaeogeographical highs, have been recognized:\r\n•\tThe Scottish Province, consisting essentially of the Midland Valley of Scotland, bounded by the Caledonian Highlands to the north and the Southern Upland High to the south.\r\n•\tThe Pennine Province of central and northern England, bounded by the Southern Upland High to the north and the Wales–London–Brabant High to the south.\r\n•\tThe Irish Province in the west.\r\n•\tThe Southern Province, south of the Wales–London–Brabant High.\r\n•\tThe Culm Basin of Devon and Cornwall.\r\nThe Scottish, Pennine and Southern provinces comprise the tectonic settings for the igneous rocks encompassed by this GCR block.The Culm Basin, south of the Variscan Front, is the setting for those covered by the Igneous Rocks of South-west England GCR Block.\r\nThe earliest magmatism occurred during the Tournaisian Epoch (c. 354–342 Ma) and is represented mainly by volcanic rocks around the Solway Firth and the England–Scotland border, although the volcanic rocks in the Mendips span from late Tournaisian to early Visean times.The most voluminous and widespread igneous activity occurred during the Visean Epoch (342–327 Ma), resulting in vast lava fields in the Midland Valley of Scotland, lavas and sills in Derbyshire, and minor volcanic sequences around the England–Scotland border.During the Namurian and Westphalian ages, volcanism became more localized in the Midland Valley of Scotland and in the East and West Midlands of England, with an increasing tendency for the magma to be emplaced as sills, and all activity died out in late Westphalian times.Following a major change in tectonic conditions, a short-lived episode of regional dyke and sill intrusion occurred in north-east England and across central Scotland in early to mid-Stephanian times, and late Stephanian and Early Permian times saw the emplacement of widespread but localized lavas, sills and dykes that now extend from the eastern Irish Sea to the north-west Highlands.Evidence of Late Permian igneous activity in Britain is restricted to dykes in the Orkney Islands.\r\nThe Carboniferous and Permian magmatism in Great Britain was of typical intraplate type, largely controlled throughout the Carboniferous Period by back-arc extension to the north of the Variscan orogenic front and, during Permian times, by major intracontinental rifting that heralded the eventual break-up of the supercontinent of Pangaea.In Scotland, the magmas were dominantly of transitional to mildly alkaline character, becoming generally more highly alkaline and silica-undersaturated with time. Some very primitive and compositionally extreme, alkali-rich lamprophyric and foiditic (feldspathoid-bearing) rocks characterized Early Permian lavas and intrusions of the Midland Valley as well as many of the dykes of the Scottish Highlands and Islands.However, many of the Tournaisian lavas around the Solway Firth and along the Scotland–England border are tholeiitic and the Visean lavas of Derbyshire are entirely tholeiitic.Some tholeiitic lavas also occur in the Westphalian rocks of the East Midlands, but other igneous rocks of central and southern England are alkaline.The principal exception to this overall pattern is the short-lived Stephanian event, which resulted in widespread intrusion of tholeiitic magmas as dykes and sills across much of central Scotland and north-eastern England.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe sites illustrate the variety and distribution of the rocks and highlight critical localities of historical and continuing national and international importance, and can be ascribed to various suites in their full geological context, and the magmatism related to the overall tectonic history of north-west Europe.\r\nThe six GCR Networks for this GCR Block are based upon petrological affinity, age and geographical distribution. Some sites have features that fall within more than one network, but can be assigned to a network on the basis of their dominant features.\r\n1.\tDinantian volcanic rocks of the Midland Valley of Scotland and adjacent areas.\r\n2.\tDinantian rocks of Northumberland, Solway and Tweed basins\r\n3.\tSilurian and Early Permian volcanic rocks of Scotland\r\n4.\tAlkaline basic sills and dykes of Scotland\r\n5.\tTholeitic sills and dykes of Scotland and northern England\r\n6.\tCarboniferous and Permian igneous rocks of central England and the Welsh borderland.",

    "Description": "A glance at even the smallest scale geological map reveals the extremely varied geology of Scotland, England and Wales. Seen against this diverse geological background it is not surprising that Great Britain is also a region of a great diversity of types and ages of mineralization.\r\nMost centres of mineralisation are clearly associated with particular geological environments and can be related to events in the geological evolution of Great Britain, and this has been the basis for the derivation of regional GCR Blocks. However, the main groups of mineral deposits or types of occurrence form the basis of the thematic  mineralogical GCR Networks.\r\n1. Minerals and mineral assemblages within igneous intrusions\r\nSites of igneous rocks which are of petrological importance are included within a number of GCR blocks. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=11' title='Click for details of GCR Block Carboniferous - Permian Igneous'>C-P-IG</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=37' title='Click for details of GCR Block Igneous Rocks of Southwest England'>IGN-SW-E</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=61' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ordovician - Silurian Igneous'>ORD-IGN</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=62' title='Click for details of GCR Block Old Red Sandstone Igneous'>ORS-IGN</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=94' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Igneous'>TER-IGN</a>. A handful of sites within Great Britain’s igneous rocks, however, exhibit features which are principally of mineralogical interest. These include several pegmatites in the western Highlands; pegmatitic segregations within the Cairngorm Granite at Loch Avon which contain assemblages of such uncommon minerals as topaz and beryl; the pyroclastic deposit with euhedral augite crystals at Bail Hill, Dumfriesshire; and the volcanic neck with pyrope garnets at Elie Ness.\r\n2. Stratiform deposits within the Dalradian rocks of the Grampian Highlands\r\nThe Dalradian Supergroup of the Grampian Highlands (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=25' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dalradian'>DAL</a>) mainly comprises a thick succession of metasedimentary rocks. The range of mineralisation within the Dalradian is very diverse. Stratiform, synsedimentary, pre-metamorphic mineralisation occurs within the Middle Dalradian and may be subdivided into two main groups. The first of these are typically barium-rich with abundant baryte and/or barium silicates: the deposit worked at Foss Mine is a good example. The second group lack barium enrichment but contain abundant copper, zinc, lead and nickel: deposits in the Loch Fyne and Tyndrum areas provide examples. In both cases a genetic model is one in which hydrothermal mineralising solutions emanated onto, or immediately below, the contemporary sea-floor during sedimentation in a series of second-order basins.\r\n3. Cambrian-Ordovician exhalative deposits of North Wales\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician sedimentary rocks of North Wales locally contain beds rich in manganese minerals. The Cambrian ‘Manganese shales’, which have in the past been worked as a source of manganese ore, contain a great variety of manganese minerals, including silicates, carbonates and oxides. It has been suggested that the manganese was probably of sub-marine exhalative origin. A similar origin has been advocated for the lenticular bodies of manganese ore within the Ordovician mudstones of the Lleyn area, North Wales.\r\nA spectacular deposit believed to be the product of exhalation of hot mineralising fluids into the Ordovician sea, through the sort of vents known today as ‘black smokers’, is seen today at Parys Mountain on Anglesey. The mineralising fluids responsible for the accumulation of the thick sequence of sulphide minerals here are considered to have been derived from sea water circulating convectively through the underlying rocks which were being heated by volcanic activity. The term ‘volcanogenic massive sulphide’ (VMS) deposit has been applied to deposits of this type. Associated with the sulphide orebodies at Parys Mountain are large areas of silica-rich mineralised rock thought to represent penecontemporaneous siliceous sinter deposits.\r\n4. Magmatic segregations associated with Caledonian intrusive rocks\r\nIn Ordovician times, during early Caledonian deformation (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a>), ultramafic and basic oceanic rocks associated with an island arc system were thrust over Dalradian and Moinian metasediments to produce the ophiolite complex seen today at Unst in the Shetland Isles. Serpentinites and associated ultrabasic rocks within this complex locally contain high concentrations of chromite in large, lenticular, pod-like bodies. Platinum group elements (PGE), present in small amounts in the chromite-bearing rocks, may have been introduced by hydrothermal processes. Shearing of parts of the serpentinite bodies has produced deposits of talc. Similar chromium-rich serpentinites are found locally within the Ballantrae ophiolite complex on the northern margin of the Southern Uplands.\r\nLayered gabbroic intrusions in North-East Scotland, which may be the roots of a volcanic arc emplaced over a northerly-directed subduction zone during the early part of the Caledonian Orogeny, locally contain concentrations of primary magmatic and remobilised iron-copper-nickel mineralisation.\r\nSmall concentrations of mainly iron and nickel minerals within a dioritic intrusion at Talnotry, Galloway also belong within this group.\r\n5. Porphyry-style mineralisation associated with Caledonian intrusive rocks\r\n‘Porphyry-style’ deposits occur in association with a number of Britain’s Caledonian intrusions (see also <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a>). In these deposits metallic mineralisation, usually dominated by either copper or molybdenum, typically occurs disseminated, as grains or in veinlets, through a very large volume of igneous rock of acid or intermediate composition. Concentric zones characterised by distinctive styles of alteration are a feature of porphyry\r\n6. Metalliferous veins associated with Caledonian intrusions\r\nCaledonian tectonism and associated igneous activity (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a>) was responsible for the emplacement of a variety of types of mineralisation. Most widespread of the deposits of Caledonian age are the numerous vein deposits found in several parts of Scotland, the Lake District and Wales. All vein deposits associated with Caledonian intrusions are considered together as one GCR network.\r\n7. Gold veins of North Wales\r\nAlthough occupying a comparatively small area, the gold-bearing veins of the so-called ‘Dolgellau Gold Belt’ may be considered to comprise a distinctive suite of deposits, and thus to constitute a separate GCR network. The gold mineralisation probably developed as a result of dewatering of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks during uplift in late Silurian times. Gold was preferentially deposited in the resultant quartz veins where methane and nitrogen were introduced into the mineralising fluids where they came into contact with the Cambrian Clogau Shales.\r\n8. Lead-zinc-fluorite-baryte veins of the Pennines, North Wales and the Mendip Hills\r\nFive discrete orefields characterised by deposits dominated by these minerals occur within limestones and associated sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous age. The largest and most important economically are the three Pennine orefields; the Northern Pennine Orefield of the Alston Block, the Northern Pennine Orefield of the Askrigg Block and the Peak District, or Derbyshire, Orefield. The North Wales and Mendip orefields are smaller and of less economic significance. Whereas each of these orefields exhibits distinctive structural and mineralogical features, all share a number of characteristics which link them together within the class of ore deposits known as ‘Mississippi Valley-type’.\r\n9. Tin-copper-arsenic veins associated with the Cornubian granitic batholith\r\nThe counties of Cornwall and Devon include one of the most intensely mineralised areas of Great Britain. Best known for its long history of tin and copper production the region has also produced a number of other metals and mineral products including ores of arsenic, iron, tungsten, cobalt, nickel, uranium and manganese. Large quantities of china clay are still produced from intensely kaolinised granite.\r\nCornwall and Devon, also known as ‘Cornubia’, form part of the northern portion of the Variscan, or Hercynian, orogenic belt. The Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the region have been metamorphosed and intruded by numerous high-level granites which unite at depth to form the Cornubian granitic batholith (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=37' title='Click for details of GCR Block Igneous Rocks of Southwest England'>IGN-SW-E</a>). Associated with the granites are numerous quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes known locally as elvans. A feature of some of the granites is the extensive metasomatism which has produced widespread tourmalinisation and greisenisation and intense kaolinisation locally. Important pegmatites are associated with some granites.\r\nWhereas a number of mineral deposits within the region can be shown to predate the granites, e.g. the numerous small manganese deposits which may have a volcano-sedimentary origin, the great majority of the region’s mineralisation is clearly genetically related to the underlying batholith. The majority of the mineralisation occurs in the form of fissure veins or lodes, the mineralogy of which is often complex. A distinct vertical and lateral variation, or zoning, in mineral content is apparent throughout the region. In general tin and tungsten mineralisation occur within or close to the granites, with the greatest concentration of copper in a zone beyond the tin-rich zone. Lead and zinc, and some antimony and iron, deposits are important in veins in the outer aureole rocks most distant from the granites. Non-metalliferous, or gangue, minerals also exhibit evidence of zoning which may also be related to temperatures of mineralising fluids. Emplacement of the main veins began during or shortly after the final stages of granite emplacement.\r\n10. Hematites of west and south Cumbria\r\nThe Lower Carboniferous limestones of west and south Cumbria host a large number of deposits composed almost exclusively of hematite. These are typically large, irregular or flat-lying replacements of limestone, usually closely associated with, or adjacent to, faults. A unique group of deposits, known as ‘sops’, is restricted to south Cumbria. In these deposits hematite fills large, roughly conical dissolution hollows in the limestone. The centre of each ‘sop’ is typically filled with sand or broken sandstone from the overlying Permo-Triassic beds. Small fissure veins of similar composition, genetically associated with these deposits, occur within the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the adjacent Lake District inlier.\r\nThe hematite deposits of west and south Cumbria are distinguished by consisting almost entirely of hematite. Other metallic minerals are generally rare, though small quantities of manganese oxides were found locally and very small amounts of galena and copper sulphides have been recorded. A restricted range of gangue minerals includes dolomite, baryte, quartz, calcite and fluorite.\r\nThe consensus view is that the iron was derived, by convective leaching, from Permo-Triassic sediments within the Irish Sea Basin. Mineralising fluids were driven up-dip through Permo-Triassic, and possibly Carboniferous, sandstones to gain access via faults, and in the south Cumbria area dissolution hollows, in the Carboniferous limestones. Estimates of the age of emplacement of these orebodies varies from Permian to post-Triassic.\r\nSimilar replacement deposits, consisting of abundant goethite as well as hematite, occur within Carboniferous limestones in South Wales and the Forest of Dean.\r\n11. Regional metamorphic assemblages.\r\nRocks of the Scottish Highlands contain numerous minerals developed during regional metamorphism. Whereas these are in general, principally of petrological interest and have are encompassed by other GCR Blocks, locally spectacular examples of these minerals occur.\r\n12. Contact metamorphic assemblages associated with intrusions of various ages.\r\nContact metamorphic rocks associated with igneous intrusions of various ages are included within a number of other GCR Blocks. A handful of contact metamorphic rocks, designated as GCR sites principally for their mineralogical interest. These sites include the highly aluminous, corundum-bearing, xenoliths in the Tertiary sills of Mull, the metamorphosed Dalradian limestones of Deeside and the skarn assemblages of the Kilchrist area of Skye and the St Just area, Cornwall.\r\n13. Amygdale-minerals in lavas.\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone lavas of central Scotland are celebrated for the occurrence within them of siliceous amygdales, commonly in the form of beautiful agates. Known as ‘Scotch Pebbles’ They have long been collected as semi-precious stones from weathered outcrops and river and beach shingles.\r\nThe lavas of the British Tertiary igneous province (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=94' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Igneous'>TER-IGN</a>) are well-known for the presence of a variety of zeolites and related minerals within vesicles and veins. Spectacular specimens of a number of these are prominent in many museum collections. Other important occurrences of these minerals include those of the Carboniferous volcanic rocks of the Midland Valley of Scotland.\r\n14. Diagenetic minerals of various ages\r\nThe sedimentary rocks of Great Britain locally contain important occurrences of minerals, or suites of minerals, of diagenetic origin. In the GCR, the mineralogical interests of these rocks is typically encompassed within the stratigraphy GCR blocks.\r\n15. Supergene assemblages\r\nWhen subjected to oxidising processes above the permanent water table, many of the primary, or hypogene, minerals of most mineral deposits are unstable and undergo a process of secondary, or supergene, alteration. Sulphide and carbonate minerals are particularly susceptible to this form of alteration. In an ideal case the upper zones of orebodies tend to be leached of most metallic elements, commonly leaving any iron present as a near surface crust or ‘gossan’. Other metals transported downwards in solution are commonly precipitated above the water table as carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, arsenates etc. Below the water table reaction of copper-bearing solutions with pre-existing copper sulphides may result in the formation of new sulphides in a zone of secondary enrichment. Particularly rich deposits of copper ores have been worked from such zones in many mines in South-West England. In certain deposits, notably some of those in South-West England, the oxidised zone is known to have extended to as much as 365 m below the surface.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site selection the mineralogy of Great Britain has been arranged into the following GCR Blocks:\r\n•\tMineralogy of Scotland\r\n•\tMineralogy of the Lake District\r\n•\tMineralogy of the Pennines\r\n•\tMineralogy of the Peak District, Leicestershire, Cheshire and Shropshire\r\n•\tMineralogy of Wales\r\n•\tMineralogy of the Mendips\r\n•\tMineralogy of South-West England\r\nHowever, the 15 GCR mineralogy networks (described above) are based upon mineralogical or genetic affinities and age as well as geographical distribution.\r\nThe importance of some sites stems from the mineralogical composition of the rocks themselves. In other cases the importance lies in individual minerals, or suites of minerals, which form parts of mineral deposits emplaced within these host rocks. As might be expected the great majority of these sites occur within the varied and generally more structurally complex pre-Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of Britain, though a number of localities within these Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks also contain minerals and mineral assemblages of considerable interest and importance.\r\nThe selected sites are therefore not confined to those which represent important features within more or less well defined mineral provinces or orefields but includes a wide range of sites drawn from across the whole field of mineralogy. Included are localities at which the mineral assemblages give important insights into mineralising or metallogenic processes as well as sites at which igneous, metamorphic or diagenetic processes have given rise to distinctive or unusual occurrences of individual minerals or assemblages.\r\nA number of sites are included primarily because they comprise the ‘type locality’ for one or more mineral species.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns.\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of the Pennines and adjacent areas. Sites important for fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nFor the Pennines and adjacent areas, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tthe pre-Devensian glacial and interglacial record\r\n•\tthe Devensian glacial record\r\n•\tThe Late-glacial record\r\n•\tperiglacial landforms and slope deposits\r\n•\tHolocene vegetation history",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the arthropods [except trilobites] GCR Block represent the British fossil record of the rarer arthropds from the emergence of the group during the Cambrian Period (which ranged from about 540 to 510 million years ago (Ma)). Triloibites are not specifically included in this block owing to the relative abundance of fossils of this group, which are used extensively in stratigraphy for the relative dating and correlation of Lower Palaeozoic rocks; sites important for trilobites are therefore included with the Stratigraphy GCR Blocks. Trilobites became extinct at the end Permian (= end Palaeozoic) mass extinction event (c. 230 Ma), although the group had been in decline well before this. Fossil insects are afforded their own GCR Block, Palaeoentomology. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=66' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeoentomology'>PALENT</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nToday, creatures as seemingly diverse as barnacles, beetles, fleas, flies, crabs, trilobtes and woodlice can all be recognised as arthropods and share a unifying body plan –a tough exoskeletal cuticular covering (carapace) to a segmented body and paired jointed legs. In order to grow, arthropods need to shed the carapace periodically. The body materials of most arthropods is purely organic and generally has a low preservation potential, except where they have been mineralised as in triliobites and many crustaceans.\r\nAfter the emergence of the group about 500 Ma, by 400 Ma the arthropods were not only well-established in the marine environment but had made the difficult transition to life on land. By around 320 Ma, the arthropods had already made the transition to the air – the first creatures on Earth to do so. The subsequent success of flying insects had a huge impact of life on land, their ‘hand-in-hand’ evolution with flowering plants in late Mesozoic times led to a tranformation fo terrestrial vegetation.\r\nTaxonomically the arthropod group has been recognised since the mid 19th century and includes insects (Devonian–Recent range), crustaceans (Cambrian to Recent), myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), chelicerates (spiders and scoprions), ostracods (Cambrian–Recent), and extinct groups such as trilobites (Cambrian–Permian), and eurypterids (Ordovician–Permian).\r\nAs well as being preserved as body fossils (including fossils of shed carapaces), trace fossils are also important, with both rare trackways and more-common burrows occurring.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe long fossil record of the group and the wide range of different depositional environments in which the fossils occur (marine, freshwater and terrestrial) has been useful in helping elucidate palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. The palaeogeography of each relevant geological stage can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nOwing to the rarity of fossil arthropod material, this GCR Block represents something of a special case with regard to including all of the sites yielding, or that have yielded, significant types and quantities of scientifically important material that help elucidate the evolution of the main arthropod groups, and help elucidate the characteristic assemblages of arthropods through time.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 100 to 65 million years ago (Ma). This interval comprises the six ages of the Late Cretaceous Epoch. Rocks that formed during the Late Cretaceous Epoch constitute the Upper Cretaceous Series, which is in turn part of the Cretaceous System.\r\nIt is from the white Chalk of the Anglo-Paris Basin that the ‘Cretaceous System’ takes its name (creta = Latin for chalk), introduced by the Belgian geologist, Omalius d’Halloy in the early nineteenth century.It was not until the late 20th century, however, that a Lower and Upper division was formalized at the base of the Chalk (strictly, at the base of the Cenomanian Stage).\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nUpper Cretaceous rocks, primarily Chalk, cover a vast area of England forming the Downs and Wolds as well as the spectacular chalk cliffs from Flamborough Head to south-east Devon. In south-east Devon and the Inner Hebrides of north-west Scotland, white chalk rests on greensands, calcareous sands and commercially important quartz sandstones.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeographical setting</h2>\r\nDuring the Late Cretaceous times, the super continents of Laurasia and Gondwanaland were breaking up and sea levels reached their maximum for the whole of the last 600 Ma, leading to chalk deposits forming on many continental regions of the world, including the British Isles.The causes of these geological events have been related to (i) bulging ocean basins (Late Cretaceous super-plume), expelling sea water onto continents; (ii) carbon dioxide levels about four times greater than today, keeping continental interiors and polar regions much warmer during winter and (iii) little or no water trapped as polar ice, contributing to high sea levels.\r\nA combination of high sea levels and warm, less oxygenated sea water compared to the present day also gave rise to three periods of black shale formation in the Cretaceous known as oceanic anoxic events (OAE). Two of these OAEs occurred in the Late Cretaceous Epoch, the first at the Cenomanian–Turonian (C/T) boundary, resulting in the Plenus Marls and Black Band lithologies 93.5 million years ago.\r\nBy the close of the Cretaceous Period, over a very short time period of perhaps only 200 000 years, huge changes had taken place on Earth that led to the disappearance of many fossil groups including the dinosaurs, ammonites, belemnites, inoceramid and rudistid bivalves and many of the chalk-forming calcareous nannoplankton. This extinction event marked the end ofthe Secondary Era, the Mesozoic. The suggested causes of these cataclysmic changes are controversial, and include inferred meteorite impact(s) in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico (Chicxulub Crater) and Bombay area, India (Shiva Crater), preceded and followed by exceptional volcanic activity (Deccan Traps), leading to a ‘nuclear-winter’.Until now, the Late Cretaceous rocks of Britain contributed little to the arguments because all of the sedimentary evidence at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene (K/P) boundary, at the time the meteorite impact is believed to have occurred, was thought to have been removed by erosion. It is possible, however, that the small remnants of rock beneath the basalts in the Inner Hebrides at Gribun (Mull) and Beinn Iadain (Morvern) may preserve the evidence at the boundary.Of particular interest would be the presence of an iridium anomaly, a key index of the K/P boundary, which is used as evidence for a bolide impact.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into four themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional province. The networks are:\r\n•\tSouthern Province\r\n•\tTransitional Province\r\n•\tNorthern Province\r\n•\tInner Hebrides Group\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Cretaceous System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’. However, other key biostratigraphical indicators for ‘The Chalk’ include belemnites, inoceramid bivalves, brachipods, echinoids (sea urchins), crinoids (sea lilies) and microfossils such as foraminifera.\r\nOther invertebrate faunas of the time included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails) and asteroids (starfish).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs were advanced; mammals formed a minor but increasingly important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Mesozoic Palaeobotany GCR Block represent the British fossil record of vascular land plants during the Mesozoic Era (which spanned from 230 to 65 million years ago (Ma)). This was a time of major evolution and diversification of plants following a major mass extinction event that occurred at the end of the Permian Period (=end of Palaeozoic Era). Earlier fossil plants are afforded their own GCR Block, ‘Palaeozoic Palaeobotany’. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=67' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeozoic Palaeobotany'>PAZ-PALBOT</a>; later plants are covered by the ‘Tetriary Palaeobotany’ GCR Block.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nFrom the earliest inter-tidal vegetation of the Silurian Period (425 million years ago), plants progressively became established on land, and eventually developed into the lush tropical wetland forests of the Late Carboniferous Period (300 million years ago).\r\nThe end of the Palaeozoic Era (c. 250 million years ago) was a time of major change in land vegetation when traumatic environmental events caused rapid extinction of many plant groups. However, a few groups survived through into the Mesozoic Era and from these the gradual development of modern vegetation can be traced through the fossil record. The emptying of the many ecological niches provided an opportunity for more advanced groups such as cycads and conifers to radiate in the Mesozoic Era, and marked the start of the development of a modern-style of vegetation. During the early part of the Mesozoic Era, many families of living ferns and gymnosperms appear and, in late Mesozoic times, the first evidence of flowering plants can be found. By the following Tertiary sub-Era, much of the vegetation was dominated by flowering plants like those of the present day.\r\nBritain has a particularly fine palaeobotancial record for mid-Jurassic (e.g. the Yorkshire coast) and early Cretaceous (Sussex coast) deposits and there are many sites internationally important for floras of these ages.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe fossil plant material has been useful in palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions as an indicator of the geological past. The palaeogeography of each relevant geological period since the earliest terrestrial vegetation of the Mesozoic Era can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 121 to 99 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the last part of the Early Cretaceous Epoch, which spans from 142 to 99 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Early Cretaceous Epoch (part of the Cretaceous Period) constitute the Lower Cretaceous Series (part of the Cretaceous System).\r\nThe Aptian (121–112 Ma) and Albian (112–99 Ma) strata are included in one GCR Block together because they are commonly closely associated in general lithology and palaeontology; these two stratigraphical stages precede the deposition of The Chalk, rocks formed during the Late Cretaceous Epoch –the name ‘Chalk’ reflecting the dominance of that rock type in strata of that age. They follow the Barremian Stage. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=20' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cenomanian, Turonian, Senonian, Maastrichtian'>CEN-MAA</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting, which was largely controlled by deep-seated structural features.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Cretaceous System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe British fossil record for the Aptian and Albian ages is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs were advanced; mammals formed a minor but increasingly important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 166 to 161 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the penultinmate Age of the Mid Jurassic Epoch, which spans from 178 to 157 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Mid Jurassic Epoch (part of the Jurassic Period) constitute the Middle Jurassic Series (part of the Jurassic System).\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nOn maps showing the solid geology of England, Middle Jurassic rocks crop out in an almost continuous strip from the Dorset coast to the North Yorkshire coast. In Scotland, Middle Jurassic rocks crop out in scattered patches in the islands to the north-west as well as in northern Scotland.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nDuring Early Jurassic times Britain was largely covered by shelf sea, however towards the end of the Epoch there was a significant fall in sea level accompanied by crustal upwarping and vulcanicity in the central North Sea Basin. Consequently, Middle Jurassic rocks reflect a variety of depositional environments including shallow marine, fluvial, deltaic, saltmarsh and coastal lagoon. In addition, limestone and clastic sedimentation (mudstone, siltstone and sandstone) was often widespread.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into five themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting, which was largely controlled by deep-seated structural features. The networks are:\r\n•\tWessex Basin\r\n•\tCleveland Basin (North Yorkshire sites)\r\n•\tEast Midlands shelf\r\n•\tWorcester Basin and Shelf (Cotswolds sites)\r\n•\tMoray Firth and Hebrides basins.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe many different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Mid Jurassic times mean that the fossil record is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). The brachiopods occurred in an abundance that was never repeated on such a scale in later geological times. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times; primitive mammals formed a minor but important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Mesozoic-Tertiary Fish/’Amphibia’ GCR Block represent the British fossil record of fishes and stem Tetrapoda and Amphibia of the Mesozoic Era and Tertiary sub-Era (the first part of the Cainozoic Era), from about 250 million years ago (Ma) to 2 Ma. At the end of the Permian Period (= end of Palaeozoic Era, preceding the Mesozoiz Era) a significant, global, mass extinction took place, enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a distinct opening signature (the total demise of all the older groups of agnathans); the end of the Tertiary sub-Era marks the beginning of the ‘Great Ice Age’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe term ‘fishes’, unlike ‘mammals’ or ‘birds’ includes a range for aquatic vertebrates across several taxonomic classes. It refers to the living bony fishes (the teleosts) and cartilaginous sharks, rays and skates (the chondrichthyans), as well as a number of surviving representatives of older groups that were much more common in the past, such as the coelacanths, dipnoans (lungfishes), myxinoids (hagfishes) and petromyzontids (lampreys). The hagfishes and lampreys are jawless (agnathan) fishes. There are also two other groups of ‘fish-like’ aquatic chordates, which are not strictly ‘fishes’. These are the living lancelets (cephalochordates) and the extinct conodonts, which are both important for understanding fish evolution and are considered within this GCR Block.\r\nFollowing the appearance of fishes in Ordovician-Silurian times, when the group were entirely marine, non-marine environments are represented in British Devonian rocks. The Devonian Period had been unmistakably an ‘Age of Fishes’ with its proliferation of species in the marine realm and the entry into fresh waters on all continents. An end-Devonian mass-extinction event involved the total demise of all the older groups of agnathans. Only the myxinoids (hagfishes), lampreys and most of the gnathostomes survived. The disappearance of so many vertebrate types made way for the gnathostomes, in particular, to radiate and expand the group.\r\nThe end-Permian mass-extinction event led to a burst of evolution and diversification in the Cainozoic Era comparable to the Devonian radiation.\r\nAs well as displaying the evolution of fossil fishes during Mesozoic and Tertiary time, Britain continues to yield invaluable material that helps eluidicate the evolution of tetrapods; the localities yielding important ‘Amphibia’ material are few in number, but are also globally rare.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe different depositional environments that developed in Britain during late Palaeozoic times are summarised on the following pages:\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=1' title='Click for details of GCR Block Aalenian - Bajocian'>AAL-BAJ</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=4' title='Click for details of GCR Block Aptian-Albian'>APT-ALB</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=8' title='Click for details of GCR Block Bathonian'>BAT</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=20' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cenomanian, Turonian, Senonian, Maastrichtian'>CEN-MAA</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=21' title='Click for details of GCR Block Callovian'>CLV</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=36' title='Click for details of GCR Block Hettangian, Sinemurian and Pliensbachian'>HET-PBN</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=40' title='Click for details of GCR Block Kimmeridgian'>KIM</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=63' title='Click for details of GCR Block Oxfordian'>OXF</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=90' title='Click for details of GCR Block Portlandian - Berriasian'>PTL-BER</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=73' title='Click for details of GCR Block Neogene'>NEO</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into three principal themes or ‘networks’:\r\n•\tBritish Triassic fossil fishes\r\n•\tBritish Jurassic fossil fishes\r\n•\tBritish Cretaceous fossil fishes\r\n•\tBritish Cainozoic fossil fishes\r\n•\tBritish Mesozoic-Tertiary stem Tetrapoda and Amphibia\r\nWithin the overall rationale of the GCR, sites were assesed with the following weightings in mind:\r\n•\tsites of international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material.\r\n•\tsites where the fossils are exceptionally well preserved, showing features not seen elsewhere\r\n•\tbest-available sites for major fish/early tetrapod–amphibia assemblages necessary to represent evolutionary succession\r\n•\tsites with particular significance to science and history of palaeontology in the development of studies of early vertebrates\r\n•\tsites enabling the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Tertiary Palaeobotany GCR Block represent the British fossil record of vascular land plants during the Tertiary sub-Era (which spanned from 65 to 2 million years ago (Ma), which was preceded by the Mesozoic Era). This was a time of further evolution and diversification of plants, with the vegetation becoming dominated by the flowering plants. At the end of the Cretaceous Period (the last Period of the Mesozoic era) there was a mass extinction event, but this did not have a significant or long term effect on plant life. The end of the Tertiary sub-Era is marked by the onset of the ‘Great Ice Age’ (Quaternary Period). Quaternary floral change in the British fossil record is recorded in Quaternary GCR sites (predominantly represented in the pollen records).\r\nEarlier fossil plants are afforded their own GCR Blocks, ‘Palaeozoic Palaeobotany’ and ‘Mesozoic Palaeobotany’. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=67' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeozoic Palaeobotany'>PAZ-PALBOT</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=49' title='Click for details of GCR Block Mesozoic Palaeobotany'>MES-PALBOT</a>. See also Quaternary GCR Blocks.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nFrom the earliest inter-tidal vegetation of the Silurian Period (425 million years ago), plants progressively became established on land, and eventually developed into the lush tropical wetland forests of the Late Carboniferous Period (300 million years ago)\r\nThe end of the Palaeozoic Era (c. 250 million years ago) was a time of major change in land vegetation when traumatic environmental events caused rapid extinction of many plant groups. However, a few groups survived through into the Mesozoic Era and from these the gradual development of modern vegetation can be traced through the fossil record. In late Mesozoic times, the first evidence of flowering plants can be found. Although the end-Cretaceous mass extinction had significant effects on faunas, it did not significantly affect plant life, since spores and seeds were able to germinate when more favourable conditions occurred after the extcintion event. Of the plant groups that did die out out this point (e.g. the bennettites) most were suffereing a marked decline during the preceding Cretaceous Period, probably as a result fo competition from flowering plants (angiosperms). By the Tertiary sub-Era, much of the vegetation was dominated by flowering plants like those of the present day.\r\nBritain has a particularly fine palaeobotancial record for early Tertiary deposits (e.g. the London Clay and there are many sites internationally important for floras of these ages.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe fossil plant material has been useful in palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions as an indicator of the geological past. The palaeogeography of each relevant geological period since the earliest terrestrial vegetation of the Tertiary sub-Era can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=73' title='Click for details of GCR Block Neogene'>NEO</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nOwing to the rarity of fossil plant material, this GCR Block represents something of a special case with regard to including all of the sites yielding, or that have yielded, significant types and quantities of scientifically important material that help elucidate the evolution of the main plant groups.\r\nThe sites can be allocated to 5 GCR networks based on distinct plant assemblages associated with different time intervals and/or palaeoenvironmental settings as follows:\r\n•\tBritish Triassic palaeobotany\r\n•\tJurassic palaeobotany of Yorkshire\r\n•\tJurassic palaeobotany of southern England\r\n•\tJurassic palaeobotany of Scotland\r\n•\tBritish Cretaceous palaeobotany.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 428 to 423 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the second epoch of the the Silurian Period (440 to 410 Ma).\r\nRocks that formed during the Wenlock Epoch form the the Wenlock Series (part of the Silurian System). The Silurian System is divided into four series (Llandovery (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>), Wenlock, Ludlow (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>) and Prídolí (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=86' title='Click for details of GCR Block Prídolí'>PRIDOL</a>)) and all but one series (the Pridoli) into a number of stages. The Wenlock Epoch is divided into two ages.\r\nOf the eight stratotypes that define the bases to the Silurian stratigraphical divisions, seven are in Britain. The one exception is the base to the Prídolí Series. The chosen level for the base of the Devonian System in the Czech Republic is considerably higher than the base of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ which had traditionally been regarded as the Silurian–Devonian boundary in the Welsh Borderland. The new Prídolí Series therefore correlates with the lowest part of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>). Graptolites and conodonts have yielded the most refined Silurian zonations, but analogous schemes exist for other groups, notably brachiopods, acritarchs and chitinozoans.\r\nFor discussion of Silurian palaeogeography and palaeontology see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 354 to 327 million years ago (Ma) as represented by rocks in southern England and South Wales. This interval is the first part of the Carboniferous Period, which spans from about 354 to 292 Ma. Rocks that formed during the during Dinantian time constitute the Dinantian Subsystem, which comprises the Tournaisian and Visean series, in turn made up from the Courceyan, Chadian, Arundian, Holkerian, Asbian and Brigantian stages. In the GCR, the Dinantian Subsystem plus Pendleian and Arnsbergian stages (the lowest two stages of the overlying Silesian Subsystem) are equated with Lower Carboniferous (or Mississipian) Subsystem.\r\nThe majority of the stages are defined at stratotype sections, either in northern England, South Wales or southern Ireland, but a stratotype section for the Arnsbergian Stage has yet to be established.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe major features controlling deposition in Britain during Early Carboniferous times owe much to structures inherited from the Caledonian Orogeny.(See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>). Closure of the Iapetus Ocean had led to the development of a suture running ENE–WSW across northern England, with differing Lower Palaeozoic geological histories on either side.The Caledonian structure of England and Wales was strongly influenced by a ‘Midlands Microcraton’ in central England.To the east of this, Caledonian structures trend north-west–south-east, but to the west and north the trend is north-east–south-west.A major feature of the palaeogeography of Britain during Early Carboniferous times is the land area of the Wales–Brabant Massif, formerly known as St George’s Land, which is, at least in part, a remnant of this Midlands Microcraton.\r\nMajor collision was taking place through Central Europe during the Early Carboniferous Subperiod as a result of closure of the Rheic Ocean, but to the north of this, in Britain, extensional tectonics prevailed.An overall north–south stretching is envisaged, although east–west tension has also been suggested.In England and Wales north of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the combination of (probable) north–south extension combined with the inherited Caledonian structures led to the development of asymmetric grabens with relative subsidence partly controlled by the position of low-density granite plutons.Rifting was pulsed, with particularly active episodes in Chadian–early Arundian and in mid–late Asbian times.Significant rifting also took place during Courceyan times.\r\nAreas undergoing slow subsidence and thus accommodating a relatively thin Lower Carboniferous succession have been variously called ‘blocks’, ‘highs’, ‘horsts’, ‘shelves’ or ‘platforms’, and the areas undergoing more rapid subsidence as ‘basins’, ‘troughs’, ‘gulfs’ or ‘lows’.\r\nSouth of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the Culm Trough and the shelf area bordering it are remnants of a back-arc basin relating to northwards subduction and closure of the Rheic Ocean.In Scotland, between the Grampian Mountains to the north and the Southern Uplands to the south, a major rift, the Midland Valley, formed, controlled by movements on inherited Caledonian faults.\r\nIn late Dinantian times, uplift of source areas led to southwards progradation of a giant clastic delta complex which rapidly filled the basinal areas.At this time, active rifting largely ceased and subsidence in Namurian and Westphalian times was regional and thermally driven.\r\nThe final closure of the Rheic Ocean led to the ‘Variscan’ or ‘Hercynian Orogeny’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>) during late Westphalian and Permian times.South of the Wales–Brabant Massif, compression resulted in thrust faulting and nappe emplacement.In northern Britain, inversion of Lower Carboniferous half-graben and subsequent erosion led to the development of a Permian–Carboniferous angular unconformity.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the Dinantian stratigraphy of Britain sites were selected according to palaeogeographically defined GCR Blocks.\r\n•\tDinantian of Scotland – Midland Valley Basin\r\n•\tDinantian of northern England and North Wales – Northumberland Trough; Lake District and Alston Blocks; Stainmore Basin and Askrigg Block; Craven Basin; Derbyshire Platform, North Staffordshire Basin and the Hathern Shelf; and North Wales Shelf;\r\n•\tDinantian of southern England and South Wales – South Wales–Mendip Shelf\r\n•\tDinantian of Devon and Cornwall\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nIn the early 20th century the first coral–brachiopod zonation schemes for the British Lower Carboniferous sequence were established; subsequently a proliferation of biostratigraphical schemes for the Lower Carboniferous successions of north-west Europe has evolved based principally on the distribution of miospores, conodonts, foraminifera and ammonoids.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 23.8 to 1.81 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the second period of the Cainozoic Era, which encompasses the history of the Earth from the end of the Cretaceous Period (65 Ma) to the present day. Rocks that formed during the Neogene Period constitute the Neogene System, which in turn comprises the Miocene (23.8–5.32 Ma) and Pliocene (5.32–1.81 Ma) epochs, and precedes the Quaternary Period. Together, the Palaeogene and suceeding Neogene periods form the Tertiary Sub-Era.The Tertiary Sub-Era comprises all but the final two million years or so of the Cainozoic Era of ‘recent life’. The definition of the end of the Tertiary sub-era, the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary has been the subject of some debate. Rocks of this age are referred to as East Anglian ‘Crags’. Two formations termed the ‘Coralline Crag’ and the ‘Red Crag’ were identified at first in 1835, followed by a third division, the Mammiferous Crag in 1837, which later became known as the Norwich Crag.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nIn Britain Neogene deposits are most widespread in East Anglia, though to a considerable extent below a Pleistocene cover, whilst elsewhere, a few outliers include the limestone fissure fills of Miocene–Pliocene Lenham Beds, preserved only in solution pipes in Kent, and of Brassington, Derbyshire. The few onshore remnants of Neogene strata provide glimpses of palaeoenvironmental conditions in the British area.\r\nThe lower Crag was termed the ‘Coralline Crag’ after the abundance of ‘corals’, later found to be the skeletal remains of bryozoans. The upper Crag was termed the ‘Red Crag’ after its characteristic ferruginous coloration. The Coralline Crag is a formation of marine skeletal carbonate sands and silty sands with an outcrop restricted to south-east Suffolk and an adjacent area of the southern North Sea. The outcrop consists of an elongate NE–SW trending main body and three small outlying bodies to the south-west of the main outcrop. Erosion, probably during the late Pliocene time, has removed much of the former extent of this deposit. The formation exceeds 20 m thick in places and everywhere rests unconformably on the London Clay Formation (Palaeocene–Eocene) which had already been deeply eroded into an undulose surface before the Pliocene marine transgression.\r\nThe Red Crag is restricted to south-east Suffolk and north-east Essex, and is marked by an unconformity at its base.In places it overlies Coralline Crag.The relationship between the Red Crag and succeeding Nowich Crag has not been yet elucidated.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nInferences of palaeoclimate from the East Anglian crag deposits have played an important part in the establishment of the stratigraphic terminology and sequence in the British Neogene. Climatic deterioration can be traced from the Coralline Crag, through Red Crag, Norwich Crag and finally to the onset of glaciation in the British Isles.\r\nFo further discussion of Tertiary palaeogeography, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a>.\r\nDuring Neogene times the North Sea occupied an area similar to that at the present time, although its extent varied with marine transgressive/regressive cycles.The main depocentre lay along the axis of the subsiding Rhine Graben and consequently thick and fairly continuous Neogene sequences are preserved in the Netherlands.In contrast, eastern England lay on the western margin of the basin and therefore the Neogene deposits here consist mostly of thin sequences of shallow marine and marginal marine sediments deposited during regional highstands and separated by long stratigraphical gaps.\r\nTo the south, uplift of the Weald–Artois Axis which began in Lutetian times had severed connection between the North Sea Basin and the English Channel and it is unlikely that this connection was restored until Pleistocene times.Certainly it is unlikely that any connection existed through the area of the modern Dover Straits until that time. There are no marine deposits of unequivocal Neogene age on the UK mainland south of this axis. If there was a Neogene seaway between the London and Hampshire basins (as has been postulated), it apparently left no deposits in the Hampshire Basin.\r\nAlthough the early to middle Miocene marine transgression was probably one of the most extensive of the Tertiary Period, and produced extensive deposits in the North Sea and continental Europe, it appears to have left little evidence in eastern England\r\nA period of regression during the late Miocene as a result of a major eustatic sea-level fall preceded a renewed transgression in the latest Miocene–earliest Pliocene.In Kent, the Lenham Beds, which may be of latest Miocene age, contain a poorly preserved fauna in decalcified ferruginous sands contained within solution pipes in the surface of Late Cretaceous Chalk.\r\nA renewed transgression in the mid-Pliocene deposited the Coralline Crag, a formation of carbonate-rich marine sands and silty sands with an outcrop on land restricted to eastern Suffolk.\r\nThe overlying late Pliocene Red Crag formation has the most extensive outcrop of any Neogene deposit in the UK and shows evidence of a shallowing-upward sequence from subtidal marine sands to intertidal sand flat deposition.\r\nDuring Neogene times, therefore, the southern North Sea was probably a semi-enclosed embayment which periodically inundated parts of eastern England. The deposits are dominantly of shallow marine and marginal marine facies (Coralline Crag and Red Crag) although in the east Midlands terrestrial deposits of Neogene age (the Brassington Formation) are preserved in solution subsidence hollows within Carboniferous Limestone.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe following networks are identified:\r\n•\tThe Lenham Beds\r\n•\tCoralline Crag\r\n•\tRed Crag\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThat Tertiary faunas and floras are essentially modern in aspect has made the task of palaeogeographical and palaeoenvironmental interpretation considerably easier than for earlier periods of geological time. Using ostracods and forams, for example, it has been possible to determine quite narrow ranges of water salinity and depth, rather than the broader generalizations so often unavoidable with older strata. The dinosaurs which had dominated the Earth in Mesozoic times had died out before the Tertiary began, to be replaced by the more readily comprehensible mammals which began to establish themselves in the Palaeocene prior to their great diversification at the beginning of the Eocene. The flora too became distinctly modern in aspect; the angiosperms flourished.\r\nSince the mid-19th century there have been reports of human artefacts and remains from both the Coralline and Red Crags of Suffolk and Essex. These have included bone spear heads from the coprolite bed, a carved shell from the Red Crag of Walton-on-the Naze, flint implements from several localities in the Red Crag including Buckanay Farmand Coralline Crag at Rockhall Wood, Sutton, and a human mandible from the Red Crag at Foxhall near Ipswich.",

    "Description": "Cave passages form through a limestone karst where there is an available flow of water, with chemical potential to dissolve the limestone, with an adequate hydraulic gradient between a sink and a rising, in a favourable geological structure. Extensive cave development therefore depends on a combination of geological and topographical factors, and on a climate which provides meteoric water charged with biogenic carbon dioxide.\r\nFor a description of karst development, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=39' title='Click for details of GCR Block Karst'>KAR</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>British karst regions</h2>\r\nMost of Britain’s caves and karst landforms occur on the thick and strong limestones of the Lower Carboniferous succession. The submarine palaeogeography of the Dinantian seas varied considerably across the area now occupied by Britain. Consequently, there is substantial lateral variation within the Carboniferous succession.\r\nThe major regions of cavernous karst are therefore defined by the major outcrops of the massive facies of the Carboniferous limestones – in the two parts of the Yorkshire Pennines, the Peak District, the Mendip Hills and South Wales. The finest limestone landscapes and the greatest extent of cave development lie in the glaciokarst of the Yorkshire Dales, formed on the thick Great Scar Limestone in the area around Ingleborough and Malham. The peripheral zone of the Northern Pennines includes all the karst on the thin Yoredale limestones, and also on outcrops of the thinner and faulted equivalents of the Great Scar fringing the adjacent Lake District and Morecambe Bay. Both the White Peak limestone area of the Derbyshire Peak District and the Mendip Hills are upland karsts which are clearly defined by geology and topography. The South Wales karst is spread along the limestone outcrop which fringes the coalfield syncline; it is not a conspicuous feature of the regional topography but it does contain many long, deep and important cave systems.\r\nEach of the five main karst regions has suites of landforms and cave systems with their own distinctive characteristics. The regional individualities are largely imposed by the geological structure, the relationships between geology and topography, and the local Pleistocene history of fluvial, periglacial and glacial stages. Outside of the main areas of Carboniferous Limestone, Britain’s karst is dominated by the large area of chalk outcrop; this has a distinctive landscape of rolling downland and dry valleys, but contains very few caves. There are more caves in the smaller outcrops of older limestones, notably in North Wales, the Forest of Dean, Devon and Scotland. The Jurassic limestones, and other less extensive carbonates, have limited development of karst landforms and very few caves.\r\nAny single cave passage evolves through three distinct stages. Initiation creates the openings through the rock, which permit the flow of groundwater and allow the accelerated erosion of the next stage. Enlargement is the main stage of cave development, when the small, initial fissues are enlarged to reach and pass the size limit of accessibility by humans, that defines a cave. Degradation is the terminal phase of destruction, where the cave either collapses, is filled with sediment or is removed by surface lowering. In a complex cave system, all three processes take place simultaneously in passages at different depths and positions in the limestone; solutional enlargement and sediment infilling can take place at the same time in a single passage.\r\n\r\n<h2>Karst and caves in the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nMost of Britain’s landforms are the products of erosion and deposition during the Quaternary Period. The broad pattern of highlands and lowlands is a function of geological structure, with origins that reach back to Tertiary and earlier times. There are also remnants of uplifted, deformed and dissected erosion surfaces which predate the Pleistocene Epoch. But most individual landforms, and all of the details of the landscapes, evolved within the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs – when the cyclic climatic variations exercised great influence over the karst processes. Solutional activity was at a maximum during each warm phase. Conversely, it was greatly reduced in most cold phases; it ceased completely in most areas during periods of total ice cover, though glacial meltwater poured through the caves in some limestone areas.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe aim of the GCR has been to represent all the important aspects of Britain’s caves, The criteria for selection have therefore been any one of four factors:\r\n1\tThe finest example of any particular landform or cave type\r\n2\tUnique sites\r\n3\tSites important for teaching and research\r\n4\tImportant assemblages of landforms/ cave features\r\nBeside their values to karst geomorphology, many caves have great importance and value in the stratigraphy of the sediments that they contain. In erosional upland environments, caves constitute unique preservation sites where sediments can accumulate in stable conditions and remain safe from destruction by continued surface denudation. The value of these sediments is enhanced by the climatic sensitivity of solution processes and karst hydrology, and also by the chronological record that is deduced from their radiometric dating. The cave sediments provide a record of events with implications for research into the evolution of landscapes far beyond the confines of the karst.\r\nMany cave entrances or passages with immediate access from the surface have been used as animal lairs or have become natural pitfall traps. These bone caves have therefore accumulated valuable records of past faunas, but their importance is to Pleistocene palaeontology rather than karst geomorphology and are described in other parts of the GCR (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=68' title='Click for details of GCR Block Pleistocene Vertebrata'>PCN-VTB</a>). Similarly, the major tufa deposits are included with the Pleistocene/Quaternary Blocks of the GCR.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cenozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>The River Thames and its forebears</h2>\r\nFew rivers of so modest a size have had so much attention devoted to their deposits and geological history as the Thames. The present size of the river belies its importance to British Quaternary geology, however, since Thames sediments provide a framework for the latest part of the geological record in Britain. Indeed, there is abundant evidence to show that the modern Thames is a mere shadow of its Pleistocene forebear. Not only did it once flow from the London Basin out across East Anglia to north Norfolk, but there are indications that its headwaters may once have drained a large part of the West Midlands and even North Wales. During Middle and Late Pleistocene cold episodes, when sea level was much lower and Britain was joined to the continent, the river extended for many kilometres over areas that now lie offshore; during these episodes it was a tributary of the Rhine system. Thus Thames deposits provide a potential means for correlation between the London Basin and other areas of Britain, as well as with the North Sea Basin and surrounding parts of the European continent.\r\nThe river has undergone a number of significant changes during the Pleistocene Epoch, some as a result of glaciation. It appears initially to have been a ‘consequent stream’, flowing along the approximate centre of the London syncline and receiving tributaries from the north and south. Many of the latter would have been of even greater antiquity, having originated on the then newly formed Weald and Chiltern uplands and draining into the sea that covered the London Basin during the Palaeogene. The central drainage of the western end of the London Basin is the province of the River Kennet, the Thames upstream from Reading probably having originated as an early river flowing southwards into the basin down the northern limb of the syncline. The presence of quartz pebbles in the Palaeocene deposits of Buckinghamshire suggests that a fluvial route through the Chilterns, tapping pre-Cretaceous strata beyond, was in existence by that time. The relative lowering of sea level, which brought about marine regression in the late Neogene, was responsible for the initiation of the Middle and Lower Thames as the main drainage line along the emergent sea-floor.\r\nIt appears that, by the Early Pleistocene, the Thames had acquired a much more extensive catchment, with Midlands and Welsh detrital material being brought into the London Basin via the Upper Thames system. There is still controversy as to whether the Thames once drained these areas directly, or whether glacial transport carried this ‘exotic’ material into its catchment during the Early Pleistocene. It is apparent that this supply ended by the Middle Pleistocene and that the Upper Thames was at that time confined to the south-east of the Cotswold escarpment.\r\nTerrace formation\r\nThere has been considerable debate about the possible correlation between the formation of river terraces and climatic fluctuation during the Pleistocene. A modified climatic model for terrace formation, which may be directly related to the climatic cycles recorded in the oxygen isotope curve is reflected here:\r\nPhase 1 Downcutting by rivers during a time of high discharge, under cold climatic conditions. The limits of this rejuvenation would be controlled by base level.\r\nPhase 2 Aggradation of sand and gravel and the formation of floodplains at the new level; energy levels remain high, but sedimentation now exceeds erosion, leading to a vertical accumulation of sediment (final part of cold half cycle).\r\nPhase 3 Limited deposition by less powerful rivers under temperate conditions (interglacial). This usually takes place in single thread channels covering only small areas of floodplains, although overbank deposits may be more extensive. Estuarine sediments accumulate above phase 2 deposits (often overlapping these) in the lower reaches of valleys.\r\nPhase 4 Climatic deterioration results in increases in discharge coupled with enhanced sediment supplies, brought about by the decline of interglacial vegetation and increases in erosion and mechanical weathering. This causes the removal and/or reworking of existing floodplain deposits and the renewed aggradation of sand and gravel.\r\nThe established sequence of Thames terrace features is as follows:\r\n9. Lower Floodplain Shepperton Gravel\r\n8. Upper Floodplain Kempton Park Gravel\r\n7. Taplow Taplow Gravel\r\n6. Lynch Hill Lynch Hill Gravel\r\n5. Boyn Hill Boyn Hill Gravel\r\n4. Black Park Black Park Gravel\r\n3. Winter Hill Winter Hill Gravel\r\n2. Rassler Rassler Gravel\r\n1. Harefield Gerrards Cross Gravel\r\nThe stratigraphical framework\r\nThe following stages are recognized for this part of the GCR in the sequence post-dating the marine crags of East Anglia (in stratigraphical order):\r\nFlandrian (warm) = Holocene\r\nDevensian (cold)\r\nIpswichian (warm)\r\nWolstonian (cold)\r\nHoxnian (warm)\r\nAnglian (cold)\r\nCromerian (warm)\r\nBeestonian (cold)\r\nPastonian (warm)\r\nBaventian (cold)*\r\n* most recent stage within the Norwich Crag, the youngest marine crag.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of the Thames area. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe selection of sites for Quaternary Thames river terrace stratigraphy attempts to encompassthis fragmentary, but complex, terrestrial sequence and correlate it with the more continuous sedimentary and climatic record from deep-sea cores. This is based on biostratigraphical evidence, with support from amino acid geochronology, and on assumptions about the correlation between cycles of terrace formation, as represented in the Thames sequence, and climatic fluctuation during the Pleistocene Epoch.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 65 to 24 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first period of the Cainozoic Era, which encompasses the history of the Earth from the end of the Cretaceous Period (65 Ma) to the present day. Rocks that formed during the Palaeogene Period constitute the Palaeogene System, which in turn comprises the Palaeocene, Oligocene and Eocene Series. Together, the Palaeogene and suceeding Neogene periods form the Tertiary Sub-Era.The Tertiary sub-era comprises all but the final two million years or so of the Cainozoic Era of ‘recent life’. The definition of the end of the Tertiary sub-era, the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary has been the subject of some debate.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nIn England, Palaeogene rocks are preserved in two east–west trending tectonic basins, the London Basin and the Hampshire Basin, and in small outliers further west as far as Devon. The oldest rocks occur in the London Basin (and its northward extension into East Anglia) where late Palaeocene to mid Eocene strata are found. A thicker and stratigraphically more extensive succession occurs in the Hampshire Basin, and it is at its thickest in the Isle of Wight where some 600 m of strata represent the late Palaeocene to early Oligocene stratigraphy.\r\nTertiary rocks of igneous origin are particularly well developed in Scotland (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=94' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Igneous'>TER-IGN</a>), but are also represented much further to the south by, for example, the Lundy Granite.\r\nThe British onshore sites in these two tectonic basins provide a record for some 25 Ma; from the sediments of NP Zone 6 age exposed in Pegwell Bay to the youngest surviving uneroded remnants of the Palaeogene on the Isle of Wight, where the uppermost part of the Bouldnor Formation may possibly be as young as NP Zone 23 in age.\r\nUnderstanding the Tertiary has been particularly enhanced by the existence of large expanses of undisturbed and non-lithified oceanic sediments which provide unbroken successions representing the whole of the sub-era and contain a record of organic, isotopic and other data for this period of geological time.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nAs the Cainozoic Era began, the Earth presented several unusual aspects. It had been warm for many millions of years, with the Jurassic to Cretaceous the longest period of the Phanerozoic without a global glaciation. Such global warmth continued into the Cainozoic Era. Apparently there were no ice-caps at either the North or South Poles. Temperatures were up to 10–15°C higher than at present in southern latitudes, but the tropics in early Tertiary times were no warmer then than they are now. Whilst the difference between tropical and polar temperatures today is about 40°C, in the Eocene this was smaller by one-quarter to one-third. At the beginning of the Palaeogene Period, Britain was at a latitude of 40° N, 12° south of its present position and was considerably warmer than at present, although from latest Early Eocene times, floristic changes indicate that the climate was gradually becoming cooler.\r\nNot surprisingly, global sea level was considerably higher during the early Tertiary than at the present day, producing a wide expanse of epicontinental seas. Later, sea levels were generally lower but there is evidence for a succession of rises and falls throughout the whole of the sub-Era. As the Tertiary began, the separation of Europe and North America continued in the North Atlantic area, with the breakup of the Greenland–Rockall Plate and the production of volcanic rocks including those of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Movement of Eurasia south-eastwards was to result in compression and shear in the Mediterranean region culminating in the various Alpine orogenic mountain-building phases. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=2' title='Click for details of GCR Block Alpine Structures of Southern England'>ALP-STR-SE</a>.\r\nDuring the Late Cretaceous Epoch, much of north-western Europe was an area of marine carbonate deposition with a few areas emergent such as the Scandinavian massif and perhaps parts of Wales and Scotland. Signs of more general emergence appeared in Maastrichtian (71–65 Ma) and more widely in Danian (65–61 Ma) times, at the end of which clastic sediments replaced the limestones that had dominated the area for the previous 40 Ma. Such a change is thought to reflect increased erosion (both subaerial and submarine) resulting from uplift associated with ocean-floor spreading in the northern Atlantic region. The latter was associated with extensive igneous activity which reached its climax in Palaeocene times and which in the British area culminated in early Eocene times.\r\nAt the beginning of the Palaeogene Period, Britain lay on the western margins of what has been called the Northwest European Tertiary Basin which extended eastwards at least as far as Poland. To the west of Britain lay the proto-Atlantic with which the latter was sometimes connected via the so-called ‘Central Channel and Western Approaches Basins’. To the immediate east of Britain, lay the major North Sea Basin where a long period of Tertiary sedimentation, fed by rejuvenated source areas particularly to the north and west, ultimately gave rise to deposits, in excess of 3000 m thick at their depocentre, representing a wide variety of environments from non- or marginal marine to bathyal.\r\nThe contrast between the thick Palaeocene succession of the North Sea area and the relatively thin and younger strata of this age in southern England indicates that much of Britain was land during the early part of the Palaeogene Period. Its existence contrasts markedly with the situation in the Upper Cretaceous Epochwhich was one of almost total submergence.\r\nThis land area was undergoing active erosion. In places, the Chalk cover had been reduced to a residuum of insoluble flints (as seen at the Tower Wood site), whereas elsewhere (e.g. the Bolter End site) evidence indicates the breaching of the Chalk and the erosion of older rocks.\r\nPalaeogene deposits are characterized by alternating marine transgressions and regressions, thought in the main to reflect global sea-level changes.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe majority of sites represent a variety of facies preserved in the paralic succession of the tectonic London and Hampshire Basins. Many of them are important both lithostratigaphically and chronostratigraphically and contain a variety of sediments and fossils which have facilitated palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographical interpretation.\r\nThe following networks are identified:\r\n•\tLondon Basin: eastern localities\r\n•\tLondon Basin: western localities\r\n•\tHampshire Basin: Isle of Wight localities\r\n•\tHampshire Basin: mainland localities\r\n•\tWestern Outliers of Devon and Dorset\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThat Tertiary faunas and floras are essentially modern in aspect has made the task of palaeogeographical and palaeoenvironmental interpretation considerably easier than for earlier periods of geological time. Using ostracods and forams, for example, it has been possible to determine quite narrow ranges of water salinity and depth, rather than the broader generalizations so often unavoidable with older strata. The dinosaurs which had dominated the Earth in Mesozoic times had died out before the Tertiary began, to be replaced by the more readily comprehensible mammals which began to establish themselves in the Palaeocene prior to their great diversification at the beginning of the Eocene. The flora too became distinctly modern in aspect; the angiosperms flourished.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 327 to 310 million years ago (Ma) as represented by rocks in England and  Wales. This interval is the middle part of the Carboniferous Period, which itself spans from about 354 to 292 Ma. Underlying rocks formed during Dinantian time (see, for example, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=27' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Northern England & North Wales'>DIN-N-E-WL</a>) constitute the Dinantian Subsystem, which comprises the Tournaisian and Visean series. Overlying rocks formed during the Westphalian Epoch (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=106' title='Click for details of GCR Block Westphalian'>WPH</a>).  In the GCR, the Dinantian Subsystem plus Pendleian and Arnsbergian stages (the lowest two stages of the overlying Namurian Series of the Silesian Subsystem) are equated with Lower Carboniferous (or Mississipian) Subsystem. Therefore British Namurian strata include rocks either side of the Lower–Upper Carboniferous boundary.\r\nThere has been much confusion as to the exact meaning of the term ‘Upper Carboniferous’. In northern Europe, it has been taken to include all of the Namurian, Westphalian and Stephanian series, as this represents an interval of largely fluvio-deltaic clastic rocks, which can be readily separated from the mainly marine shelf limestones of the underlying Viséan. It is placed just above the base of the Chokierian Stage in the European classification. For convenience, the base of the Chokierian Stage is used in the GCR as an approximation to the lower limit of the Lower Carboniferous subsystem.\r\nNow, all of the eight stages of the Upper Carboniferous, from the Chokierian, Alportian, Kinderscoutian, Marsdenian, Yeadonian, Langsettian, Duckmantian and Bolsovian are defined by stratotypes in this country.\r\nNamurian rocks in Britain can be roughly equated to the informal term ‘Millstone Grit’, which is overlain by the ‘Coal Measures’ and underlain by the Dinantian ‘Carboniferous Limestone’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nBritain has some of the best-exposed sequences of non-marine Upper Carboniferous strata anywhere in Europe. Nowhere else has such extensive coastal exposures of these beds, as can be seen in Pembrokeshire, Northumberland, Cumbria and Fife. Even outside of Europe, one would struggle to find comparable coastal exposures, at least within the palaeoequatorial belt, with the possible exception of Nova Scotia in Canada (e.g. Joggins Bank, Point Aconi). Britain is also unusually well endowed with natural, inland exposures. For instance the Pennines is a classic area for Namurian studies, with their extensive exposures of Millstone Grit.\r\nThere is considerable variation in the lithostratigraphical development of the Upper Carboniferous strata of Britain, and different areas often have their own set of formations. Only ‘the Productive Coal Formation’ (the mainly Westphalian, grey, coal-bearing deposits) has a reasonably wide distribution. However, there is an underlying pattern of lithofacies recognizable over much of the country, and this is recognized here as five groups listed as follows.\r\n•\tCulm Group\r\n•\tYoredale Group\r\n•\tMillstone Grit Group\r\n•\tPassage Group\r\n•\tCoal Measures Group\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe Upper Carboniferous of Britain was formed in an elongate belt of deposition lying between Poland and Ireland, that marks the contact-zone between the Gondwana and Laurasia continental plates. Originally separated by deep ocean (the ‘Proto-Tethys’), the Gondwana plate progressively drifted north relative to the Laurasia plate during Late Palaeozoic times. By Late Carboniferous time, the deep ocean had totally disappeared, and eventually the collision caused significant uplift and deformation of the Laurasian foreland. This tectonic episode is termed the ‘Variscan (or Hercynian) Orogeny’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>). However, between the times of ocean closure and basin inversion, a complex set of localized, synorogenic basins developed on the foreland.\r\nThere are four main mechanisms that have been proposed for how these basins were generated: (1) the northwards subduction of Gondwana under Laurasia, (2) transtension due to east–west mega-shear along the Gondwana-Laurasia plate boundary, (3) nappe loading due to the northwards migration of the Variscan front, and (4) north–south rifting and ocean spread due to the opening of a ‘Proto-Atlantic’ Ocean.\r\nThe result has been five discrete areas of deposition, separated by areas of non-deposition and sometimes erosion. These are, from south to north, Sabrina, the Wales–Brabant Barrier and the Southern Uplands Massif.\r\n(1)\tThe Culm Trough in south-west England. This was a shallow marine basin that was progressively filled during the Namurian by northerly derived deltaic sediments. Basin inversion and tectonic deformation here was rather earlier than in the rest of Britain, probably sometime in the middle part of the Westphalian Epoch.\r\n(2)\tThe Kent Coalfield, which is effectively a western extension of the Franco-Belgian Basin. This coalfield is known only through boreholes and underground mine workings, therefore as there is no exposure.\r\n(3)\tThe area immediately south of the Wales–Brabant Barrier, including principally South Wales, the Forest of Dean and the Bristol–Somerset coalfields. Like the Culm Trough, the Namurian strata are characterized by the progressive infill of a shallow marine basin by deltaic sediment, although it seems to have been ‘less marine’ than the Culm deposits. During the early and middle Westphalian times (up to the middle Bolsovian), deposition was characteristically in a fluvio-delatic regime, with extensive peat deposits. In late Westphalian times, however, uplift mainly to the south resulted in the influx of mainly arenaceous fluvial deposits (the Pennant Formation).\r\n(4)\tThe area between the Wales–Brabant Barrier and the Southern Uplands Massif, and including the northern English Midlands, the Pennines, and northern England. Again, the Namurian is characterized by mainly northerly-derived deltaic deposits filling a shallow marine basin, and the lower and middle Westphalian by fluvio-deltaic deposition. Unlike further south, however, there is no evidence of major fluvial deposits in upper Westphalian strata, except in the southern margins of the area. Instead, the progressive development of Variscan movement resulted in the formation of red beds such as the Etruria Formation.\r\n(5)\tThe Midland Valley of Scotland. The general facies development here is similar to the area south of the Southern Uplands Massif, with predominantly arenaceous deposits in the Namurian, coal-bearing deposits in the lower Westphalian and red beds in the upper Westphalian. However, marine influence was significantly reduced, with the result that marine bands are fewer and less well developed. Also volcanicity was a much greater influence, both as an influence on basin configuration, and on sedimentation itself (e.g. the Ayrshire Bauxitic Clay Formation).\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the Upper Carboniferous stratigraphy of Britain sites were selected according to palaeogeographically defined GCR networks\r\n•\tCulm Trough\r\n•\tSouth Wales\r\n•\tForest of Dean and Severn coalfields\r\n•\tBristol-Somerset Basin\r\n•\tEnglish Midlands\r\n•\tNorth Wales\r\n•\tMillstone Grit of the Central Province\r\n•\tCoal Measures of the Pennine Basin\r\n•\tNorthern England\r\n•\tScottish Basin\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology</h2>\r\nFive main groups of fossils have been used for biostratigraphical work in the British Upper Carboniferous strata: ammonoids (goniatites), conodonts, non-marine bivalves, microspores and plant macrofossils.\r\nMost stratigraphical correlations in the British Upper Carboniferous are based on biostratigraphical criteria. However, there are two types of ‘marker horizon’ available in these strata that provide valuable, abiotic means of establishing time-planes.\r\nThe most widely used are the marine bands. During the Late Carboniferous, Britain saw a progressive change from predominantly marine to predominantly non-marine conditions, and the preserved sedimentary sequence can be interpreted in terms of the interplay between these two broad environments.\r\nThe second type of ‘marker horizons’ consists of cineritic tonsteins, which were the result of volcanic ash-falls.",

    "Name": "Mesozoic Mammalia",
    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Mesozoic Mammalia GCR Block represent the British fossil record of mammals from the emergence of the group in the Triassic Period (which ranged from about 200 to 130 million years ago (Ma)), through the remainder of Mesozoic Era (ending 65 Ma); the fossil record for Cainozoic times (i.e. from the end of the Cretaceous Period to the present) is encompassed by the Tertiary Mammalia (65–2 Ma) and Pleistocene Vertebrata (2 Ma to 10 000 years ago) GCR Blocks.\r\nPalaeontological/palaeobiological  characteristics\r\nThe mammals arose during the Late Triassic Epoch (227–205 Ma) from a reptile group commonly termed the ‘mammal-like reptiles’. Mammals and mammal-like reptiles together form the clade Synapsida, one of the major divisions of terrestrial vertebrates. During the Carboniferous Period (354–292 Ma) there arose a new group of tetrapods, the amniotes, which had broken the link with dependence on water. Amniotes lay eggs that act as small ‘private ponds’, so they no longer have to lay their eggs in water. The amniotic egg has a semi-permeable outer membrane and shell that allow gases, but not water, to pass through, a supply of food (yolk) and a waste-disposal system. Amniotes today include reptiles, birds and mammals.\r\nThe basal Amniota divided during the Carboniferous Period into three main branches, the Anapsida, which led to modern turtles, the Diapsida, which led to modern crocodiles, birds and lizards, and the Synapsida. British sites that are important in documenting these early phases of amniote, and synapsid, evolution are encompassed by the <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=70' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic'>PER-TRI</a>-RP GCR Block.\r\nMammals arose from cynodonts, a group of largely carnivorous synapsids that arose in late Permian times (the Permian Period ranges from 292–251 Ma). During the Middle (242-227 Ma) and Late (227–205 Ma) Triassic epochs, certain smaller cynodonts showed the key transitions to mammals in the nature of the lower jaw.\r\nMammals are distinguished by a number of features, notably their expanded brain, which fills the whole posterior portion of the skull, and with the braincase bony elements fused to the outer skull bones, double-rooted cheek teeth (premolars, molars), and a jaw articulation between the dentary (lower jaw) and squamosal (skull). These features contrast with tritylodonts (a type of cynodont) and other reptiles, which have a much smaller brain, and the braincase elements generally remain separate from the outer skull bones, single-rooted cheek teeth, and a jaw articulation between the articular (lower jaw) and quadrate (skull). The expansion of the braincase and the shift of the jaw joint happened in several stages through the Triassic Period.\r\nSome commentators have restricted the term ‘Mammalia’ to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals only, hence excluding many Mesozoic groups traditionally called mammals, but in the GCR the traditional definition is used, thereby the Mammalia are defined by the switch from an articular–quadrate jaw joint to a dentary–squamosal jaw joint.\r\nThe early Mesozoic mammals include 10 or so groups, known best from the Jurassic (205–142 Ma) System of Europe and North America, with some of the earliest known sites occurring in Britain. Modern mammal groups probably appeared during the Late Jurassic Epoch, although the oldest fossils are Early Cretaceous (192–99 Ma) in age. Modern mammals fall into three subclasses: the Monotremata – the platypus and echidna from Australasia – which lay eggs; the Marsupialia – the pouched mammals of Australasia and the Americas – which produce tiny young that complete their development in the pouch; and the Eutheria – placental mammals – which produce relatively developed young. All these modern mammal groups exhibit hair, warm-bloodedness (endothermy), large brains and extended parental care, and they suckle their young from milk-producing glands, or mammae, hence the name ‘mammal’.\r\nThe oldest monotreme fossils are isolated jaw fragments from the Early Cretaceous Epoch (192–99 Ma) of Australia. The oldest marsupial and placental fossils are again isolated teeth and jaws, from the mid-Cretaceous Period of North America and Asia.\r\nBy the end of the Cretaceous Period (65 Ma) the marsupials and placentals were relatively diverse. Most of the more primitive mammal groups had long disappeared, and only two families of marsupials died out during the Cretaceous–Tertiary mass extinction, 65 million years ago, which saw the end of the dinosaurs and other large reptiles.\r\nDuring the Tertiary Sub-Era (65–1.8 Ma), the marsupials at first existed mainly in the Americas. They spread to Europe, where they occur commonly in Eocene and Oligocene faunas, and they also dispersed to Asia and north Africa. In the Americas, the marsupials diversified during Tertiary time, especially in South America, where they became important components of the faunas, especially as small to large carnivores. By the early Eocene Epoch (55–34 Ma), marsupials had spread across Antarctica to Australia, where they evolved into a diverse array of familiar animals, from wombats to kangaroos. Marsupials became extinct everywhere by the end of Miocene times (5 Ma), except in South America and Australia, and they subsequently re-invaded parts of North America more recently. Both Australia and South America were largely isolated from the rest of the world during the Tertiary Period, so their mammals evolved independently, marsupials in Australia and marsupials and other unusual mammals, including sloths and armadillos, in South America.\r\nOnly about half of the modern orders of mammals had appeared  by the Palaeocene Epoch (65–54 Ma), but almost all of the 20 or so modern groups had appeared by the early Eocene Epoch, around 50 million years ago. The various primitive Palaeocene groups largely survived into the Eocene Epoch and some continued for a little longer than that, but they all eventually disappeared. Most of the modern orders are known in the fossil record of the Eocene Series onwards in Europe, including the excellent Eocene sequences of the south of England:\r\n\r\n<h2>Modern mammalian orders</h2>\r\nThe Edentata restricted mainly to South America, where sloths, anteaters and armadillos evolved. Close relatives are the Pholidota – the pangolins – known today from Africa and south-east Asia.\r\nThe Insectivora, represented today by shrews, hedgehogs, moles and their relatives, are all small insect-eating forms, and they are known from most good Tertiary localities.\r\nThe Carnivora, represented by modern cats, dogs, bears, seals and sealions, came to the fore between the Eocene and Miocene epochs. The feliforms, or cats, civets, mongooses and hyaenas, include many extinct forms that were similar to living representatives, but also many sabre-toothed cats. The caniforms – dogs, bears, racoons and weasels – and the marine forms also included some unusual extinct forms – the amphicyonids, something like giant bear-dogs. The marine carnivores – the pinnipeds, including the seals, sealions and walruses evolved in the Oligocene Epoch from terrestrial caniforms.\r\nThe Scandentia, or tree shrews, are a small group of squirrel-like animals from Asia. The Dermoptera, or flying lemurs, include two species from south-east Asia and a single Eocene fossil from Thailand. Close relatives are the extinct Plesiadapiformes from the early Tertiary Period: tree-dwelling plant-eaters that were once erroneously classified as primates. The primates themselves include an array of forms: the lemurs, lorises and bushbabies, the tarsiers, the Old World and New World monkeys and the apes. The apes evolved from Old World monkeys, and they have a rich fossil record, especially in Miocene deposits in Africa. Humans of course belong here, and the oldest humans are from rocks dated as over 4 million years old, in East Africa. The Chiroptera – the bats – have a long history dating back to the early Eocene Epoch, when the oldest bats looked very like modern forms.\r\nThe largest modern order of mammals, the Rodentia, consists of 1800 species today – about 40% of all mammal species. Most of these are myomorphs – mice, rats and their relatives – a group that radiated explosively in the past 20 million years. Other rodent groups include the sciuromorphs (squirrels and beavers) and the hystricognaths (guinea pigs, capybaras and chinchillas), a group restricted to South America. The Lagomorphs – rabbits and hares – are close relatives of the rodents, as probably are the Macroscelidea, the elephant shrews of Africa.\r\nAmong modern mammals, the ‘ungulates’, or hoofed mammals, include all the large plant-eaters. The Perissodactyla usually have an odd number of hooves on each foot (one in horses, three in rhinoceroses), and the axis of the foot passes through the middle toe. Horses had a mainly Northern Hemisphere distribution. The earliest dog-sized Pliolophus (formerly known as Hyracotherium), from the beginning of the Eocene Epoch, evolved through larger Oligocene to Pliocene forms to the modern Equus. Fossil rhinoceroses were once much more widespread and diverse than they are today. Extinct perissodactyls include the large brontotheres, with forked nose horns, and the strange gorilla-like chalicotheres. Feet of the Artiodactyla have even numbers of hooves: two in modern camels, deer and cattle, but four in ancestral Eocene forms and in modern pigs and hippos. Extinct relatives of the pigs include some unusual forms, especially the huge, rather terrifying entelodonts from the mid-Tertiary Period. Camels, cattle and deer came to the fore especially after the Miocene Epoch. These groups are characterized by a complex digestive system that allows them to ruminate their food (‘chew the cud’) so as to extract maximum nutritive value from it.\r\nOther ‘ungulate’ groups include the Order Cetacea – the whales. Whales arose in Eocene times, evolving from land-living carnivorous mammals. There were some primitive long, serpent-like whales in the Eocene Epoch, the archaeocetes (such as Basilosaurus). After the Eocene Epoch, whales evolved into their two modern groups, the odontocetes or toothed whales (flesh-eating dolphins, porpoises, killer whales) and the mysticetes, or whalebone whales, the giants that feed on plankton. A small, possibly ungulate, group, is the Order Tubulidentata, represented today by the African aardvark, an ant-eating form. The Proboscidea – elephants and their relatives – evolved largely in Africa and expanded worldwide as a diverse and successful group in the Miocene Epoch. Extinct forms include the deinotheres, with curved tusks on the lower jaws, the gomphotheres, with four tusks, the mastodonts and the mammoths. These groups disappeared as the world became colder, although the mastodonts and mammoths adapted to the cold of the Pleistocene ice ages and then mostly disappeared 10 000 years ago as the ice receded. Some mammoths survived on Arctic islands until around 3700 years ago. Close relatives of the proboscideans are the Sirenia (the sea cows) and the Hyracoidea, the small rabbit-like hyraxes of Africa and the Middle East.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe palaeogeography of each relevant geological period since the appearance of the earliest British fossil mammals of the Mesozoic Era can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website.

Representation is especially good in the Jurassic Period and Early Cretaceous Epoch, the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, and the Pleistocene Epoch.\r\nThe fossil mammal GCR sites selected are widely distributed across Great Britain, with an inevitable clustering of Mesozoic and Tertiary sites in southern England, associated with the main belts of outcrop. One exception is the important Middle Jurassic site on Skye in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. The Pleistocene localities are more widely distributed, including cave locations in Carboniferous limestone regions of central England, Wales and south-west England, and bedded terrestrial, fluvial and marine sediments of Scotland and northern, eastern and southern England.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the magmatic rocks of south-west England that fall within the northern European Variscan fold belt (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a>); they are dominated by pre-orogenic volcanic rocks and post-orogenic granites, together with minor volcanic rocks, that span the Devonian and Carboniferous systems (from 417 to 292 million years ago, Ma).\r\nVolcanic activity in Britain during Devonian–Carboniferous time can be broadly divided into two geographically separate areas that show contrasting eruptive and tectonic settings. The volcanic rocks of south-west England are dominated by medium- to deep-water submarine extrusives, shallow intrusive rocks and volcaniclastic rocks generated within rifted ensialic troughs and narrow ocean basins that appear to characterize the Variscides as a whole. Subsequently, they were extensively tectonized and metamorphosed during the different stages of the Variscan Orogeny and are thus characteristic of pre-orogenic volcanism. On the other hand, the foreland continental environment to the north in central-northern England and southern Scotland was outside the active orogenic belt and, as a consequence, deformation of volcanic rocks was relatively limited. The eruptive setting was also different. The calc-alkaline Old Red Sandstone volcanic rocks of southern Scotland (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=62' title='Click for details of GCR Block Old Red Sandstone Igneous'>ORS-IGN</a>) are dominated by subaerial lavas and volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with thick sequences of intermontane sedimentary debris. Similarly, the extensive basaltic volcanic rocks of Carboniferous age in northern England and the Midland Valley of Scotland (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=11' title='Click for details of GCR Block Carboniferous - Permian Igneous'>C-P-IG</a>) are characterized by subaerial lavas and shallow, but often thick, intrusive complexes. Another significant difference is that volcanism continued throughout the Carboniferous in the northern area, whereas in South-west England it terminated in the Visean in response to thrust-generated crustal shortening.\r\nThe post-orogenic granite batholith volumetrically dominates the magmatic rocks found in south-west England.\r\nOf no less importance is the Lizard Complex in south Cornwall, a fragment of obducted ophiolite with an attendant sedimentary melange. If the early Devonian age for this dismembered ophiolite is correct, then it has European significance as being one of the few remnants of ocean crust exposed in the external zone of the Variscides.\r\nThe regional setting –Variscan Orogeny\r\nA large part of the geology of Europe from Poland to Iberia is represented by the broad, sinuous, roughly E–W-trending Variscan fold belt which has affinities with the Appalachian Belt on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean and the Uralide Belt in Russia.\r\nThe Variscan Orogen of northern Europe consists of a series of Ordovician to Carboniferous rift-generated basins, separated by metamorphosed crystalline ridges, which were progressively closed by the northward migration and subsequent collision of African Gondwanaland with northern Baltica. The Variscan orogenic belt is divided into a number of tectonic zones separated by major thrusts, ranging from the northern (external) Rhenohercynian zone to the (internal) Saxothuringian and Moldanubian zones of central Europe. The Rhenohercynian and Saxothuringian zones include basinal sedimentary sequences and volcanic rocks indicative of initial rifting and later synorogenic sandstones heralding subsequent closure. Although much of the basic–acid volcanism of these basins is typical of rifted continental crust, basaltic lavas with mid-ocean ridge (MORB) chemical characteristics are present and suggest that narrow oceans floored by oceanic crust were generated. Between these two zones in central Europe is the Mid-German Crystalline Rise largely composed of pre-Devonian magmatic and high-grade metamorphic rocks that have their counterpart in Armorica as the crystalline Normannia High. The Moldanubian zone is dominated by largely Precambrian magmatic and metamorphic rocks overprinted by Variscan tectonometamorphic events.\r\nEssential to the Variscan story is the staged closure of the sedimentary basins by subduction of narrow oceanic segments and northwards-directed thrusting from late Ordovician through to Carboniferous time, such that many sequences are thrust bound and parautochthonous or allochthonous in character. In contrast to the general northwards convergence and progressive closure throughout much of the Palaeozoic, the basinal region that formed in the Rhenohercynian zone was not only late in development, but rapidly closed – opening in early Devonian and closing by the end of late Devonian time.\r\nThe magmatic rocks covered by this GCR Block are all within the external Rhenohercynian Zone of the Variscides, some of which have features in common with their counterparts in the rest of the orogen. The sedimentary and volcanic record of the Rhenohercynian Zone reflects an early Devonian rifting event that was rapidly followed by late Devonian to late Carboniferous crustal shortening that produced stacks of northwards-converging nappes and accompanying low-grade regional metamorphism. Relatively high-level, post-orogenic, granite magmatism is a common feature of this zone.\r\nBasic–acidic volcanism is a characteristic of all Variscan tectonic zones, although volcanic sequences are generally dominated by basalts (‘spilites’) with minor trachytes and rhyolites (‘keratophyres’ and ‘quartz keratophyres’). Early Devonian rhyolites and late Devonian–Dinantian basalt pillow lavas and intrusives in south-west England have their temporal counterparts throughout the Rhenohercynian and Saxothuringian Zones, although the Moldanubian zone also exhibits late Dinantian calc-alkaline andesite-dominated volcanism. Throughout the Rhenohercynian zone most of the basalts are incompatible element-enriched, intraplate tholeiites and alkali basalts – the latter of which are particularly characteristic of south-west England. However, Middle and Upper Devonian basalts within stratigraphically restricted melange sequences have chemical affinities to MORB and, together with the Lizard ophiolite and Start Complex in Cornubia, they provide evidence for the existence of Rhenohercynian oceanic crust. Another chemical characteristic that appears to be a common feature of the basalts within the Rhenohercynian (and possibly Saxothuringian) Zones is the change in degree of incompatible-element enrichment from the Devonian to the Carboniferous. This is probably a reflection of the change from generally depleted MORB-type basalts in mid-late Devonian rift zones to the more enriched intraplate basalts of late Devonian and early Carboniferous age on the margins of basins.\r\nAs far as the Variscan granites are concerned, all the tectonic zones contain granitic massifs, many of which include types resembling those of the Cornubian batholith. In addition to older pre-Variscan intrusives and metamorphics, two or three distinct intrusive phases are found.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nTwo inter-related criteria were used for the selection of sites in south-west England:\r\n1. to provide a full stratigraphical coverage of different magmatic activity throughout the Hercynian fold belt;\r\n2. to illustrate the special or unique petrological and chemical characteristics of different magmatic units and their petrogenesis.\r\nThe sites can be conveniently grouped into four main networks (A–D) that roughly relate to stratigraphical age and major magmatic events within the Variscan Orogeny.\r\n(A) Lizard ophiolite melange and Start Complex\r\nThe plutonic complex of the Lizard ophiolite includes the serpentinized peridotite, gabbro and basaltic dykes, together with heterogeneous acid–basic gneisses that play an important role in the interpretation of early Variscan basins in south Cornwall; they also provide evidence for subsequent northward obduction. Although a volcanic carapace to the ophiolite is not present in sequence, tectonically associated, metamorphosed lavas (now hornblende schists) chemically similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts are consistent with a Lizard ocean-crust model. The metavolcanic greenschists of the Start Complex also exhibit mid-ocean ridge chemical features and may represent another tectonized segment of the early Variscan ocean floor in this region.\r\n(B) Pre-orogenic volcanic rocks\r\nThis unit comprises various stratigraphically localized volcanic rocks which were erupted contemporaneously with basinal sedimentation. They range in age from Devonian to early Carboniferous, but culminated in late Devonian–Visean times. Although they represent a bimodal basic–acid suite (the old ‘spilite-keratophyre association’), the volcanic rocks are dominated by basaltic pillow lavas and high-level intrusives of both tholeiitic and alkaline character. Basic and acidic tuffaceous volcaniclastics are also common throughout the Upper Palaeozoic. The volcanic rocks invariably have been altered subsequent to consolidation and deposition.\r\n(C) Cornubian granite batholith\r\nThe culmination or late stages of the Variscan Orogeny were marked by the emplacement of the Cornubian batholith at the end of the Carboniferous Period.\r\n(D) Post-orogenic volcanic rocks\r\nShortly after consolidation of the batholith and regional uplift, a post-orogenic volcanic episode began in late Carboniferous–early Permian times, comprising both suprabatholithic acide volcanism and mafic intrusive and extrusive rocks related to fault-bounded troughs.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 491 to 483 million years ago (Ma), as represented by the rocks deposited during the first epoch of the Ordovician Period (495–440 Ma), which is the second period of the Palaeozoic Era (545 to 251 Ma). Rocks that formed during the Ordovician Period constitute the Ordovician System. Both Cambrian–Tremadoc and Tremadoc–Arenig boundary sites have their own GCR Blocks. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=17' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian - Tremadoc'>CAM-TRE</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>.\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of Britain are essentially of marine origin; freshwater and subaerial deposits have been identified only in settings where volcanic edifices were raised above sea level.  Within the marine setting there are rocks of the widest variety, from sandstones and limestones of the shoreline and shallow shelves to beds that accumulated in deep basins or on the continental slopes.  Transects from shelf to basin are seen in both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and examples of shallow- and deep-water deposits are recognized in both Anglo-Welsh and Scottish areas.\r\nThe traditional series of the Ordovician System are Tremadoc (oldest), Arenig, Llanvirn, Caradoc and Ashgill (youngest).  There are no globally agreed divisions of the Cambrian System, although ‘Lower’, ‘Middle’ and ‘Upper’ are widely used, but not universally defined.",

    "Name": "Fluvial Geomorphology of England",
    "Description": "The subject of this GCR Block is fluvial geomorphology, the branch of Earth science that is particularly concerned with rivers and with their present behaviour, the effects that they have in contemporary scenery, the landforms rivers produce and the ways in which they have developed in the past. Scenery in Britain is closely associated with rivers. Because no area is very far from the sea there are no very large rivers, but since the country includes areas with more than 1000 mm of precipitation annually, there are large numbers of rivers and streams. An understanding of rivers past and present can provide an indication of how rivers might change further in the future. This GCR Block aims to encompass sites important for understanding river processes and how British river history has been deciphered.\r\n\r\n<h2>River processes</h2>\r\nThe network of river channels that makes up the fluvial system is really a series of linked ‘conveyor belts’ because water and sediments do not progress continuously through the system. Storage of water in lakes or in the deeper pools of river channels occurs for relatively short periods of time, but sediment and solutes can be stored in or adjacent to river channels for much longer periods of time.\r\nThe ‘conveyor belt’ also transports solid material, which is rolled or jumped along the bed of the channel as bedload, or carried as sediment suspended in the stream flow. Some materials dissolve in the water and are transported in solution. The bedload is obtained largely by erosion of the river bed and the banks of the river channel. The size (calibre) of the bed material available to the river may reflect the legacy of glaciation, if glacial deposits provide a source of bedload for the river. During downstream transport of the bedload, considerable differences exist in the size of the material, which decreases downstream; in the roundness of the material, which rapidly increases to a particular level and is then maintained; and in the composition of the bed sediments because some survive longer than others. Intermediate in character is the suspended sediment, which can be derived from channel bed and banks, but also from slopes, pipes and cultivated areas.\r\nSediment and solutes do not continue uninterrupted on the ‘conveyor belt’ throughout any drainage basin. It is the interaction between storage and transport of sediment and water which gives rise to characteristic forms of scenery, or ‘landforms’, associated with rivers and their channels. For example, along the course of a river channel there is an alternation between shallow areas, called riffles, and deeper pools, sediment may accumulate in bars and these are the temporary locations for material; longer-term storage of sediment can occur in the floodplain; river channels gradually shift by erosion of one bank and deposition on the other, and in this way meanders can gradually be translated. The ‘conveyor belt’ in the river basin is made up of streams and rivers which collectively make the drainage pattern. The river channel planform is usually divided into two major types, those that are single-thread and composed of a single river channel, which may be either meandering or for short distances may be straight; and those which have more than one channel, are multi-thread, and are described as ‘braided’ river channels.\r\n\r\n<h2>The history of fluvial processes</h2>\r\nReconstruction of the way in which scenery was fashioned can use evidence from morphology and landforms, from sediments and from deductions about the way in which processes operated in the past.Particularly dramatic landforms created under past conditions are large meandering valleys, now occupied by small underfit streams, which were produced when river discharges were much larger than those of the present time. In some cases river valleys that received water from glacial drainage channels, which were created by meltwater from melting glacier ice, or draining from lakes impounded by ice, were a feature of the Quaternary environments of northern and western Britain. In the headwaters of drainage basins, particularly on limestone and sandstone rocks, there are extensive networks of dry valleys, and examples are included in the Quaternary GCR Blocks. These valleys, without any trace of stream channels at the present time, were also produced when the hydrological cycle of the past involved greater amounts of surface runoff.\r\nSome features were produced by changes in sediment distribution and, for example, along some small rivers in upland Britain, there are sequences of deposits laid down as alluvial fans which have now been abandoned and dissected by present streams. Abandoned channels survive along many rivers as remnants that may be dated from the organic deposits which infill the old channels. Many of the river systems of Britain are still endeavouring to recover from the most recent glacial and cold phases, which produced vast quantities of sediment. Materials from glacial deposits are still being released into the fluvial system. In many parts of Britain, such as Scotland and north-east England, the present fluvial system clearly records the legacy of recent and of earlier glaciations. We therefore have a landscape today in which river systems are still recovering from the impact of different processes in the past.\r\nThree main reasons explain the differences between the past and present conditions. The most obvious is the impact of changes of climate. Not only did the Quaternary bring a series of glaciations that affected much of the northern parts of Britain, but to the south of such glacier ice were climatic conditions that resembled the contemporary Arctic climates of northern Canada or Russia. This meant that the regimes of rivers were typically very seasonal, with little or no flows during the winter months and very large floods before and immediately after the spring thaw, followed by lower flows for much of the summer. Under such conditions, when the ground was frozen so that infiltration was not possible, extensive networks of valleys were produced, later to become dry valleys, and larger river discharges characteristically occurred along river valleys compared to those of the present time. Secondly, there have been changes along river valleys instigated by sea-level change. Such sea-level changes have affected the levels to which river activity could work and so allowed the destruction of original valley floors, remnants of which now remain as river terraces. In some cases the development of incised meanders occurred after significant lowering of river levels. A third difference between the present and the past is that the influence of human activity today is very substantial, whereas in the past it was often less significant. Many rivers and river channels have been modified as a consequence of deliberate changes by human action so that streams have been channelized for flood control, for drainage, to prevent erosion and for improvement of navigation. A particularly dramatic way in which fluvial systems of the past were changed was when deforestation between 2000 and 4000 years ago released quantities of fine sediment which were transferred into the river systems and which are very evident in the floodplain sediments of major rivers. In the upper Thames basin it has been shown how flooding and alluviation were largely restricted to the past 3000 years.\r\nFor the purposes of the GCR fluvial geomorphology sites were selected according to regional ‘Blocks’. Within the ‘Fluvial Geomorphology of England’ GCR Block, sites were selected to represent three prinicpal regions: North-west England; North-east England; and central and southern England, which form distinct fluvial geomorphological areas.\r\n\r\n<h2>Holocene fluvial development in North-west England</h2>\r\nThe river systems of north-west England fall into five main groups, the Mersey, Ribble, Lune and Eden drainage basins, and the radial drainage of the Lake District. Almost all have undergone a similar sequence of Late Pleistocene and Holocene development. With the exception of a small part of the Dane headwaters in the Mersey system, the whole area lies within the Devensian glacial limits and therefore was under glacial ice at the Devensian maximum (i.e. c. 18 000 BP). The Loch Lomond Readvance (c. 10 000 BP) affected only small parts of the Lake District mountain catchments. The modern river systems were therefore initiated during the Devensian deglaciation between c. 18 000 BP and c. 14 500 BP, by which, approximately, the margins of the Lake District had become ice-free, and by implication when the regional ice sheet had melted from outside the Lake District, leaving still under ice only the Lake District valleys, and possibly the far north of the region within the limits of the disputed Scottish readvance.\r\nThere then followed a period of periglacial activity, interrupted by warmer conditions during the Windermere interstadial, culminating in the intensely cold phase of the Loch Lomond stadial, before hillslope stabilization under an increasing vegetation cover took place in Early Holocene times. A relatively stable early Holocene landscape under an almost complete woodland cover is envisaged, providing little sediment to what were presumably relatively stable rivers. However, for the later part of the Holocene, there is considerable evidence for fluvial change resulting from increased hillslope erosion as the woodland cover decreased, perhaps in part as the result of climatic deterioration, but increasingly under direct human impact.\r\n\r\n<h2>Holocene fluvial development in North-east England</h2>\r\nThe principal river systems of north-east England are the Tyne, the Wear and Tees, and the Cheviot rivers in the northern part of the region (Coquet, Aln, Till) that flow eastwards to the North Sea. The sites, with the exception of two upland streams in the Yorkshire Dales (Shaw Beck) and Cheviot Hills (Harthope Burn), however, all lie within the watershed of the River Tyne and its major tributaries. The Tyne basin contains a diverse range of physiographic and geological terrains with contemporary and Holocene channel forms, and alluvial deposits, representative of north-east England in particular, and northern England as a whole.\r\nNorth-east England was ice-covered during the Last Glacial Maximum, at around 18 000 BP, and glacial erosion and sedimentation from this and earlier glaciations have strongly influenced Holocene river development in the region. In response to declining sediment supply after deglaciation, and glacio-isostatic adjustments, upland and piedmont reaches of many rivers in the region have entrenched their valley floors in postglacial times, forming well-developed flights of river terraces. In some upland catchments, most notably in the Cheviot Hills, partial refilling of valley floors has occurred more recently, following major deforestation in the prehistoric and early historical periods. In contrast, the vertical tendency of channels in the lower Tyne, Wear and Tees valleys during the Holocene has been one of episodic, progressive alluviation. This was in response, principally, to rapid sea-level rise in the early Holocene and anthropogenically induced accelerated catchment erosion in more recent times.\r\nThe Tyne catchment is developed predominantly on Carboniferous sandstone, limestone and shale, with igneous outcrops in the headwaters of the North Tyne and along the lower part of the South Tyne valley. The geology of the North Tyne catchment compared to the South Tyne catchments (the principal tributaries of the River Tyne), however, differs in detail; the South Tyne and its tributaries (Black Burn, Nent, West and East Allen) drain the Northern Pennine orefield, which was once the most productive lead and zinc mining area in Britain. Fine-grained sediment from the South Tyne basin has a distinctive geochemical signature that can be recognized in Holocene alluvium downstream in the Tyne valley. Investigations of the dispersal of 19th and early 20th centuries mining waste in the region’s rivers have been especially valuable in this context, enabling long-term and large-scale fine sediment transport processes and storage patterns to be studied.\r\nAs in many other base-metal mining areas in Britain historical mining activity significantly increased sediment delivery to rivers in the Tyne catchment, and resulted in widespread contamination of the South Tyne and Allen systems, and much of the Tyne River, downstream as far as Newcastle. The input of coarse material took place mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries primarily through a primitive, but very effective form of hydraulic mining called ‘hushing’. Headwater streams in the mining areas of upper Tynedale, Weardale and Teesdale were most affected, with hushing causing localized river aggradation and channel planform change. The impact of the more easily dispersed finer metal-rich wastes was more widespread. Being phytotoxic, high levels of lead, zinc and cadmium in this material severely impaired vegetation growth, reducing bank stability and colonization rates of gravel bars, promoting river instability and braiding.\r\nPresent river channels in the Tyne basin are inset either within Pleistocene glacial and glaciofluvial deposits, Holocene alluvium or bedrock. Holocene river sediments range from coarse gravels in the Northern Pennine uplands and piedmont, deposited by laterally and vertically active near-braided channels, to sandy and silty alluvium in the lower parts of the basin, characterized by vertical accretion and relatively low rates of channel migration. Local differences in valley slope, degree and nature of channel confinement and the calibre of bed and bank sediment have, however, engendered considerable diversity in both Holocene sedimentation styles in the Tyne basin and present-day river channel patterns and bar development.\r\n\r\n<h2>Fluvial landforms and processes in central and southern England</h2>\r\nThe boundary between the ‘Highland Zone’, of the north and west of Britain, and the ‘Lowland Zone’, of the south and east, is usually taken as a line running approximately from the mouth of the River Exe to the mouth of the River Tees. The area defined here as central and southern England includes some portions of the Highland Zone. These are principally found in south-west England, where three upland plateau areas of western Cornwall rise above a landscape that is dominated by coastal low plateaux cut across resistant Palaeozoic rocks. Also representing the upland scenery and resistant rock theme of the Highland Zone are the Mendips and the Quantocks, although the limestone features of such areas as the Mendips are included in another volume in this series. The central and southern Pennines also have the relief, scenery and resistant rock outcrops characteristic of the Highland Zone. Such areas have features similar to those already described for Wales and for north-west and north-east England.\r\nMuch of the remainder of the area is made up of two types of landscape which are scarplands or lowlands. A cuesta is an asymmetrical feature made up of a steeper scarp slope and a comparatively gentle dip slope that leads into a vale which is usually underlain by clay. This scarpland pattern of alternating scarp, dip slope and vale is a recurrent theme across much of central and southern England and makes up the scarpland landscape of much of southern Britain. The scale of cuestas varies very considerably from one area to another. Overlooking the lower Severn valley, the scarpland of Jurassic rocks at Birdlip Hill is up to 250 m above the Vale of Gloucester. The Cretaceous Chalk outcrops of southern, southeastern and eastern England are also characterized by cuesta landscapes, and there are major scarp slopes bordering the Chalk outcrops in Lincolnshire and in south-east England, where there are scarps bordering the North and South Downs. Although these are the major scarp and dip slopes making up cuesta landscapes, there are many smaller cuestas picking out variations in lithology that make up the diverse geological map of southern and central England.\r\nA second type of area is made up of lowlands, which include the areas of the Fens, the London Basin, the Hampshire Basin, the lower Severn valley and the Trent and Ouse lowlands of eastern England, and also the Vale of Pickering, between the Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire Moors and the Cretaceous rocks of the Yorkshire Wolds. In these lowland areas the surface rocks and deposits are usually comparatively young and often include sequences of recent Quaternary sediments.\r\nAlthough the contrast between the Highland and Lowland zones, and also the basic character of the cuesta landscape and of the lowlands, owes much to the underlying rock type and the superficial deposits, there are several other distinctive themes that have influenced the pattern and character of river development in central and southern England.\r\nFirstly, there are still traces of the original east-flowing rivers which were thought to have provided the ancestors of the present river system in Britain. Thus the Trent has east-flowing sections that were complemented by a north-flowing section when rock types allowed the development of subsequent streams. The Thames is also dominantly eastward-flowing, and originally there was an east-flowing major river along the line of the present Solent. Many characteristics of rivers in central and southern England reflect the fact that the headwaters of many rivers originate in the Highland Zone. The fluvial characteristics of some rivers of central and southern England need to be seen as depositional counterparts of fluvial systems of the Highland Zone. Thus headwaters of the Severn and Wye in Wales are associated downstream with the characteristics of the middle and lower Severn, draining into the Bristol Channel. Similarly, the Trent, Ouse and Humber receive characteristic Upland rivers from the Pennines and from the North York Moors.\r\nA second major characteristic of central and southern England is that the recent evolution of the landscape is still firmly imprinted on the scenery. This is particularly significant because the most recent glaciation did not extend over much of this area, and the most southerly maximum limit of Quaternary glaciation was north of the present River Thames. This means that, according to the influence of glaciation, three major areas can be distinguished in central and southern England: one north of the Devensian limit, influenced particularly by deposits in the most recent glaciation; a second, to the south, where there are areas influenced by earlier glaciations; and a third, over the southernmost areas and in south-west England, where there are areas which were periglacial and beyond the maximum limits of Quaternary ice sheets. Whereas, in this southern area, the periglacial influence of permanently frozen ground (or ‘permafrost’) and a much more seasonal climatic regime produced river systems in the past which were different in character, regime and extent from those of today, in formerly glaciated areas there are some thick deposits of till, fluvioglacial sands and gravels, and diversions of drainage such as that of the Severn, which have all influenced characteristics of the present fluvial system. Along rivers such as the Severn, the Trent and the Thames, terrace sequences clearly indicate the stages of river and valley development.\r\nA third theme arises from interaction with the sea. Estuarine influences in the areas adjacent to the Humber, the Bristol Channel, the Severn estuary, the Thames and the Wash arise because river activity and sediment transport and accretion interact with estuarine circulation and sedimentation. The finer sediments that reach estuarine environments may be influenced by different chemical processes involving, for example, flocculation of clays in saline waters. The largest area of alluvium in Britain surrounds the Wash, and sedimentation in this area, and also in the Vale of York, the Thames estuary and the Somerset Levels, has resulted not only from offshore sources from marine sedimentation, but also from peat and salt marsh development.\r\nHuman activity is a fourth theme, because it has had a greater effect on the fluvial system of central and southern England than in other parts of Britain. Deforestation is now known to have had a significant influence upon lowland rivers, and considerable amounts of alluvium have accumulated along rivers, including the Severn and the Thames, as a consequence of deforestation over the past 4000 years, which released suspended sediment transported by rivers and accumulated along floodplains. More recent drainage modification, particularly along river valleys in the Chalk areas of central and southeastern England, include water meadows developed for irrigation purposes, which still complicate the pattern of river channels.\r\nA fifth dominant influence is that the rivers of central and southern England are essentially low-power channels, and in this sense contrast dramatically with those of Wales, northern England and Scotland, owing to low relief causing low river velocities; lower precipitation than in other parts of Britain; and because the extent of the permeable rocks is very considerable in this area.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe present fluvial system in Britain blends together the impact of present processes with the landforms produced by processes of the past, and the sites were selected for the GCR as the best examples to exemplify these two stages.\r\nThere is a general sequence of four major types of fluvial landscape in Britain, which can be thought of as proceeding from headwater areas, through gorges, to floodplains and finally to estuarine tidal areas. Each of these major types has particular characteristics, but there are also major contrasts between the upland and lowland zones and between the glaciated and non-glaciated areas. A major distinction within a river valley is between bedrock reaches, mainly in the upstream sections, and alluvial reaches, mainly downstream. Contrasts in river characteristics can be related to rock types and their interaction with relief and water quantity. A further contrast is between areas that have been glaciated, especially in the most recent Quaternary glaciation, and those that have not. In the former there are ample deposits for rivers to excavate and to modify, whereas in the latter there has been ample opportunity for the impact of cold climatic conditions and different fluvial regimes.\r\nA further contrast between the south and east of Britain and the north and west is the degree of human activity which has affected the present fluvial system and which continues to exert pressure upon it. Direct changes are very well exemplified by the distribution of channelization in England and Wales, the sites of dams and reservoirs, where water power has been generated, where gravel or river deposits have been extracted, or where river diversions have been engineered.\r\nSome sites are relatively static in their characteristics and need to be conserved as representatives of features inherited from past types of landscape-forming conditions. Other sites are still dynamic, undergoing active processes that continue to change the landforms.\r\nIt has been possible to group the sites into five major categories or ‘networks’: (A) fluvial landforms associated with a particular process or a particular stage in fluvial landform development; (B) sites associated with a particular aspect of contemporary fluvial processes; (C) river channel pattern and floodplain features; (D) Quaternary channel change; (E) impact of human activity on the fluvial landscape or upon the river system.\r\nA.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 200 to 184 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first part of the Jurassic Period; together with the succeeding Toarcian Age this age range constitutes the Early Jurassic Epoch. Rocks that formed during the Early Jurassic Epoch (part of the Jurassic Period) constitute the Lower Jurassic Series (part of the Jurassic System).\r\nThe Hettangian (200–197 Ma), Sinemurian (197–192 Ma) and Pliensbachian (192–184 Ma) strata are included in one GCR Block together because they are geologically commonly closely associated –over much of southern England they approximately equate with the lithostratigraphically defined terms, ‘Lower Lias’ and ‘Middle Lias’, (the Toarcian Stage being equated to the ‘Upper Lias’).\r\nWith few exceptions these deposits are fully marine and mark a striking contrast with the predominantly terrestrial deposits of the preceding Triassic System. They encompass a broad range of facies representing a correspondingly diverse range of environments. Most of these facies are fossiliferous, sometimes richly so, occasionally yielding exceptionally preserved material.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThe main outcrop of the Lower Jurassic Series in Britain forms an almost unbroken strip of varying width extending from the east Devon and the west Dorset coast, NNE through Somerset, Gloucestershire, the east Midlands and Humberside, to the coast of Cleveland and North Yorkshire. Significant outliers occur on either side of the Bristol Channel, in the Hebrides and adjacent west coast of Scotland, and in north-east Scotland, with others around Prees in Shropshire and Carlisle in southern Scotland.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nBritain lay between 30° and 40° north of the equator during early Jurassic times and occupied a key position in an epeiric seaway extending south-east into Tethys and north-east towards the Arctic. Although the break-up of Pangaea had commenced in Middle Triassic times, about 230 Ma, with rifting already well advanced by the start of the Jurassic Period, true ocean crust did not start forming in the north Atlantic until Toarcian times, about 180 Ma. Hence throughout early Jurassic times the major landmasses of North America and Greenland never lay far to the north and west, with further extensive areas of land present to the north-east in Scandinavia. These may have formed a source of some of the terrestrial elements of the biota, such as plants, insects and dinosaurs, which are found occasionally in these marine sediments, though many may have originated from the various minor islands which must have dotted this shallow seaway.\r\nIn a reconstruction of the palaeogeography during early Jurassic times published in 1992, it was considered that much of Scotland, the London Platform and the extreme south-west of England were land areas. The Mendip Hills and south-west Wales were considered to have been land for part of early Jurassic times but had become submerged by Toarcian times.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into three main themes or ‘networks’, reflecting regional setting, within which sites were selected to represent the lithostratigraphical formations. The networks are:\r\n•\tSouthern England and Wales\r\nBeacon Limestone Formation\r\nBlue Lias Formation\r\nCharmouth Mudstone Formation\r\nDyrham Formation\r\nMarlstone Rock Formation\r\n•\tNorthern England\r\nCleveland Ironstone Formation\r\nRedcar Mudstone Formation\r\nScunthorpe Mudstone Formation\r\nStaithes Sandstone Formation\r\n•\tScotland (Hebrides Basin only)\r\nArdnish Formation\r\nBlue Lias Formation\r\nBreaknish Formation\r\nPabay Shale Formation\r\nScalpay Sandstone Formation\r\nStornoway Formation\r\nThe GCR sites selected include representatives from the main outcrop and from the main outliers, with the exception of the Carlisle and Prees outliers where there are no permanent exposures.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe many different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Early Jurassic times mean that the fossil record is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). The brachiopods occurred in an abundance that was never repeated on such a scale in later geological times. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times; primitive mammals formed a minor but important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history as represented by the suite of carbonate rocks known collectively as the ‘Magnesian Limestone’, mainly types of limestone and dolomite that was formed near the margins of shallow tropical seas during the last 6 million years of the Permian Period. This period is the last of the Palaeozoic Era (540–250 Ma). The greatly varied character of the rocks indicates formation in a complex mosaic of tropical shallow-water marine sub-environments, ranging from lagoons to barrier bars, reefs to basin-margin slopes.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nThe distribution of marine Permian strata in mainland Britain emphasizes a great disparity between the widely scattered but mainly small occurrences in north-west England and the wide extent and almost continuous outcrop in north-east England.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block is concerned with rocks laid down in and near epicontinental tropical seas that covered low-lying tracts of northern Europe perhaps for 5–7 million years during the late part of the Permian period; Britain then lay deep within the Laurasian supercontinent, with a climate that was both hot and dry.\r\nDuring early Permian and early Late Permian times, northern Europe was part of one of the world’s great deserts, with a topographic and climatic range matching much of that of the present Sahara; widespread barren uplands created during the Armorican earth movements were gradually ground down as early Permian desert erosion led to extensive peneplanation of vast areas of Carboniferous rocks (especially Westphalian Coal Measures), and post-orogenic and extensional subsidence resulted in the formation of extensive, sub-sea-level, inland drainage basins in areas now occupied by the Irish and North seas and some adjoining land areas. It was these basins, surrounded by persistent and inhospitable deserts, that were flooded to form the Bakevellia and Zechstein seas.\r\nThe inferred mode of creation of the two seas gave rise immediately to classic barred basins, with sills that remained sensitively close to world sea levels. Both seas were particularly prone to relative sea-level changes and the thick sedimentary sequences formed in them display an extraordinary variation in their facies and extent. The sea-level changes stemmed from the complex interplay of several main mechanisms, including glacio-eustatic oscillations, isostatic effects, deepening and shallowing caused by periodic reversals in the relative rates of sedimention and subsidence, and, when the sills became emergent during oceanic low-stands, rapid evaporative downdraw. Cyclicity, caused at least partly by these relative sea-level changes, is on a range of scales and is expressed both by incomplete marginal sequences resulting from repeated transgressions and regressions and in a wide variety of carbonates and evaporites. Some variation of lithology and biota also stemmed from repeated and protracted phases of basinal anoxicity, a natural outcome of restricted circulation in a barred basin; benthic communities at these times were confined to marginal and shoal areas above an oscillating pycnocline.\r\nThe age of Zechstein and Bakevellia Sea strata in world chronostratigraphic terms is uncertain because these seas lay in the Boreal Realm and their faunas evolved almost independently of those in the Tethyan Realm upon which late Permian stages are now mainly based; a late Permian age is generally agreed.\r\nAlthough few late Permian shorelines in the British Isles can be recognized with certainty, projection of sedimentological and thickness trends suggests that the Bakevellia and Zechstein seas generally extended no more than a few kilometres beyond the present outcrops of late Permian strata and remained separated by a Proto-Pennine barrier that waned with time but was surmounted by the sea only briefly and locally during the third of four main cycles of the English Zechstein sequence. The Zechstein Sea itself was divided into several sub-basins, and early Zechstein Basin marginal depositional environments in north-east England fell into distinct Durham and Yorkshire provinces, separated by the Cleveland High.\r\nThe low relief and aridity of the Proto-Pennines and most other hinterlands, together with the prevalence of onshore trade winds, ensured that the Zechstein Sea in England received relatively little terrigenous sediment and most of the late Permian marine rocks there contain less than 2% of siliciclastic grains (mainly wind-blown); in contrast, the hinterland of much of the Bakevellia Sea was generally more elevated and rugged than that of most of the English Zechstein Sea, and terrigeneous input was correspondingly greater. In both basins, occasional storms resulted in flash floods which swept coarse continental debris far across the coastal plains and led to the formation of marginal breccia lenses and wedges.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nTogether the sites represent two networks that covers most of the geology of the Late Permian marine sequence in northern England.\r\n•\tLate Permian marine and associated strata in north-west England and adjoining areas. The strata are widespread beneath the eastern Irish Sea, but extend far inland only in the Solway Firth and south Lancashire/north Cheshire areas where arms of the Bakevellia Sea extended eastwards. The sequence is up to about 350 m thick in the basin centre, where hydrocarbon exploration has disclosed much new information, but thins sharply towards the basin margins where sequences are condensed and incomplete. Exposures on land are concentrated in these basin-marginal areas, especially in west and south Cumbria and around Greater Manchester, and most include intercalations of continental strata that indicate periodic proximity to cyclically migrating shorelines.\r\n•\tLate Permian marine and associated strata in north-east England. The strata crop out almost continuously (partly beneath drift) from Tynemouth southwards to the outskirts of Nottingham and comprise a sequence of mainly dolomitized limestones that individually and together thicken progressively eastwards. These carbonate rocks form the basal part of three main evaporite cycles (EZ1 to EZ3), and at depth farther east are separated by evaporites which, in present coastal districts of Yorkshire and much of the North Sea Basin, form most of the sequence. At outcrop the carbonate units are separated by erosion or emersion surfaces, some in combination with siliciclastic beds or evaporite dissolution residues, and some have been affected by large-scale dissolutional foundering. The main Cycle EZ2 carbonate unit does not crop out in Yorkshire but is thick and widespread in County Durham and Tyne and Wear.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=70' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic'>PER-TRI</a>.",

    "Name": "Karst",
    "Description": "Component of a karst landscape; however, caves are commonly defined as natural cavities large enough to be entered by humans, and some karst landscapes on the softer rocks are drained by fissures too narrow to be described as true caves. Caves have a separate ‘Block’ in the GCR – see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=19' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caves'>CAV</a>. Limestone is the only common rock that is highly soluble in natural surface waters, so nearly all karst is formed on limestone. Dolomite may have karstic landforms, generally less well developed than those on limestone. Some karst features are formed by solution of gypsum or salt.\r\nMost cavernous limestones are strong rocks, capable of spanning large underground voids and forming stable cliffs; they are also massive, with widely spaced fractures, some of which are enlarged by solution to form discrete conduits. Chalk is the best known of the weaker, porous limestones, which form a type of karst with few caves large enough to be entered by humans.\r\nKarst lands tend to provide some of the more spectacular natural landscapes, with hills and mountains of white crags and bare rock pavements, pitted by sinkholes and caves. Though limestones are soft (in that they are easily abraded), many are mechanically strong due to their microstructure of interlocking crystals, and all are topographically resistant because much of their erosion is underground; even the weakest limestones, such as chalk, survive as the high ground. For the same reason, limestone karst contains many deep and spectacular gorges; formed in climatic environments of the past, they are preserved because their walls are not eroded by water which has sunk underground.\r\nThe preservation of landforms within a karst landscape is most significant beneath the ground surface. A complex cave system is the only erosional environment where each phase of erosion does not remove the features of earlier phases. Capture and diversion of drainage, rejuvenations and steady downcutting create new cave conduits at lower levels, and preserve the products of earlier erosion and deposition that have been abandoned in high-level cave passages – on a scale which can never be achieved in an evolving, eroding and lowering surface topography. Caves are therefore especially significant to geomorphological studies, as their erosional features and accumulated sediments are unique records of past environments in upland regions.\r\n\r\n<h2>Karst distribution in Britain</h2>\r\nThe karst of Great Britain is formed on a number of limestones spaced through the stratigraphical column, and also on some units of gypsum and salt. The outcrops of these rocks therefore define the areas of karst landscape, which are widely distributed across England and Wales, but are rather sparse in Scotland. Most of the karst and cave GCR sites are on or in the massive limestone of the Lower Carboniferous Series (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=27' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Northern England & North Wales'>DIN-N-E-WL</a> for example); this is by far the most important karstic rock in Britain, though the largest area of karst is on the Cretaceous Chalk (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=20' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cenomanian, Turonian, Senonian, Maastrichtian'>CEN-MAA</a>), which has very limited cave development.\r\n\r\n<h2>Karst geomorphology</h2>\r\nBoth the broadest structure and the topographic texture of a karst terrain are determined by the lithology, strength, porosity and structure of the exposed carbonate succession. In contrast, the main landforms, the karst types and many of the smaller solutional features are all functions of process, and can be identified in karst regions on all types of limestone, as well as on many other types of soluble rock. Features represented in the GCR include dolines, sinkholes, blind /headless or pocket valleys, allogenic or through valleys, karst gorges, dry valleys, limestone pavements and karren as well as representatives of the main karst types (se below).\r\nLimestone pavements and karren\r\nSubaerial and subsoil limestone surfaces are etched by solution into a variety of small features. Dominant are the solution runnels, which are better known by the German term, karren. These are most conspicuous on the bare limestone pavements which were scraped clean by the Pleistocene glaciers in the northern Pennines. Postglacial solution by rainwater enlarging the bedrock fissures has left a pavement of in situ limestone blocks, each locally known as a clint and separated from its neighbours by grikes.\r\n\r\n<h2>Karst types</h2>\r\nDifferent assemblages of limestone landforms create identifiable karst types which are largely related to the present and past climatic environments in which they have evolved. Within each type, the geological structure of the host soluble rock determines the patterns of underground drainage and also influences the surface topography. The contrasting karst types in the different regions of Britain are functions of both Pleistocene history and local geology.\r\nGlaciokarst is characterized by the inheritance of glacial landforms, and is distinguished by the bare rock surfaces scoured by Pleistocene (or more recent) glaciers. Limestone pavements and scars form on the tops and edges of the outcrops of stronger beds; they are fretted by postglacial karren, and there is minimal development of postglacial soil cover. Deep karst gorges were formed by temporary meltwater rivers, but generally there are few dry valleys. The Yorkshire Dales contain Britain’s finest glaciokarst.\r\nFluviokarst is characterized by dendritic systems of dry valleys. The finest area in Britain is the Peak District, where the valleys were largely excavated under periglacial conditions during the Pleistocene. Karst gorges are developed where the valleys entrenched into steeper slopes, but there are few rock scars; most outcrops of the limestone are covered by soils of solutional residue and aeolian loessic silt.\r\nPolygonal karst is a more mature karstic terrain where dolines have replaced valleys as the main form, and a polygonal network of topographical divides has replaced the dendritic systems of interfluves. This type of karst is poorly represented in Britain, where the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and glaciations repeatedly interrupted solutional erosion; it is better developed in Mediterranean climatic regimes.\r\nTropical karsts are the climatic extreme, where the negative landforms of valleys and dolines are replaced by the positive, residual landforms of cones and towers. There is no trace of these karst types in Britain’s modern landscape.\r\nFossil karst or palaeokarst has its solutional landforms buried by later sediments of either clastic or carbonate composition. It includes features as old as the intra-depositional structures within the Carboniferous limestone sequence, and the many fissures filled with Triassic sediments. It also includes the many buried and filled dolines containing Tertiary and Quaternary sediments in the Carboniferous limestones of the Peak District and in the Chalk of southeast England; the latter include the many buried and steep-sided features commonly known as pipes.\r\nChalk karst is a very distinctive style of topography, developed on the mechanically weak, porous, very permeable and only mildly cavernous chalk; it extends across large outcrops in south-east England. It has extensive dry valley systems, which were enlarged under periglacial conditions, and numerous subsidence dolines formed in weak cover rocks. Soil cover is complete, and there are no scars or crags in the weak rock. Underground drainage is efficient, but there are few caves large enough to be accessible.\r\nSalt karst and gypsum karst are formed on the respective evaporite rocks, both of which are extremely soluble in water. Surface landforms are dominated by solution dolines and broad depressions too shallow to be described as true dolines; these occur on both rock types in Britain. Gypsum karst may also have large cave systems, but there are only a few small caves in Britain’s gypsum.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe aim of the GCR has been to represent all the important karst types and best examples of karst features. The criteria for selection have therefore been any one of four factors:\r\n1\tThe finest example of any particular karst landform\r\n2\tUnique sites\r\n3\tSites important for teaching and research\r\n4\tImportant/representative assemblages of landforms features\r\nFor the purposes of the GCR sites were selected according to karst regions (following the main limestone areas of Britain), although comparisons between the regions were made to ensure that although karst areas were adequately represented in the GCR, that karst features of similar types were not over-represented.\r\n•\tYorkshire Dales\r\n•\tNorthern Pennines\r\n•\tPeak District\r\n•\tMendip Hills\r\n•\tSouth Wales\r\n•\tRest of Britain.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent youngest stratigraphical division of the Precambrian strata of Scotland (cf. <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=43' title='Click for details of GCR Block Lewisian'>LEW</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=56' title='Click for details of GCR Block Moine'>MOINE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=99' title='Click for details of GCR Block Torridonian'>TOR</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=88' title='Click for details of GCR Block Precambrian of England & Wales'>PRE-EG-WL</a>), the uppermost part containing a Cambrian fauna (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=16' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian'>CAM</a>). ‘Precambrian’ is a broadly used term for rocks that pre-date the Cambrian Period, i.e. were formed before the Phanerozoic Eon. It encompasses such a vast span of time, extending back to at least 4000 Ma, and has been subdivided into two Eons, the Archaean ––and the younger Proterozoic Eon. The Precambrian rocks selected for this block belong to the latter, specifically to its youngest part, which has been given the chronological term ‘Neoproterozoic’.\r\nDalradian rocks are typically developed in the high ground that lies to the east and south of the Great Glen of Scotland. This was the old Celtic region of Dairadia. The rocks consist in large proportion of altered sedimentary strata, now found in the form of mica-schist, graphite-schist, andalusite-schist, phyllite, schistose grit, greywacke and conglomerate, and epidiorites, chlorite-schists, hornblende schists that probably mark sills, lava-sheets or beds of tuff, intercalated among the sediments. The Dalradian rocks include the ‘Eastern or Younger schists’ of eastern Sutherland, Ross-shire and Inverness-shire, as well as the metamorphosed sedimentary and eruptive rocks of the central, eastern and south-western Highlands. The Dalradian has been traced into the north-western counties of Ireland. The whole of the Dalradian complex has suffered intense crushing and thrusting.\r\nThe Dalradian Supergroup of Scotland is one of the thickest (~20km) and allegedly most complete Neoproterozoic-Cambrian stratigraphic successions world-wide, containing a possible 250 million year (Ma) record of evolving Neoproterozoic environments. In the absence of a fossil record, the geochronology and stratigraphic correlation of these metasediments have relied on the use of local time-markers (e.g. dating volcanic rocks) and chemo-stratigraphical correlation techniques, and are therefore largely unconstrained. Although subjected to regional metamorphism and multi-phase deformation, the Dalradian contains large tracts of low-grade and less intensely deformed rocks. Within these, lithostratigraphic relations and sedimentary features are well preserved, providing critical evidence of sedimentary environments, and the wider tectonic and environmental controls on sedimentation and basin evolution.",

    "Description": "The geology represented by this GCR Block are the highly metamorphosed rocks of Precambrian age in Scotland that are older than the Dalradian (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=25' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dalradian'>DAL</a>).  Moine rocks are considered to be the metamorphic equivalent of the Torridonian strata (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=99' title='Click for details of GCR Block Torridonian'>TOR</a>).\r\n‘Precambrian’ is a broadly used term for rocks that pre-date the Cambrian Period, i.e. were formed before the Phanerozoic Eon. It encompasses such a vast span of time, extending back to at least 4000 Ma, and has been subdivided into two Eons, the Archaean, and the younger Proterozoic Eon. The Precambrian rocks selected for this block belong to the latter, specifically to its youngest part, which has been given the chronological term ‘Neoproterozoic’.\r\nThe ‘Moine Thrust Belt’ forms the outer edge of the Caledonian mountain belt in northern Scotland (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a>), separating the deformed and metamorphosed orogenic interior of Moine and Dalradian rocks from the undeformed foreland of the Lewisian crust (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=43' title='Click for details of GCR Block Lewisian'>LEW</a>) with its sedimentary cover of Torridonian and Cambro-Ordovician successions. As such, the thrust belt defines the north-west limit of the Ortho-Caledonides.\r\nThe Moine Thrust may be defined as the tectonic contact which carries the Moine metasediments together with the Lewisian basement upon which they were deposited. These units were carried onto Cambro-Ordovician and Torridonian sediments which overlie their own Lewisian basement. The thrust is characterised by extensive mylonite development in both its footwall and hangingwall. The mylonite zone is locally several hundred metres thick. In general, where that stratigraphic separation across the thrust is greatest, particularly when the footwall lies in carbonates of the Durness Group, the mylonite zone is carried by a discrete fault zone marked by cataclasites. Such behaviour, indicating a transition from ductile deformation with relatively high temperature crystalline plasticity to brittle faulting and fracture processes, is predicted to occur on fault zones that migrate up through the crust. The transition occurs on all sections across the thrust belt, locally within the deformation zone associated with the Moine Thrust as indicated above and elsewhere within underlying, later thrusts which stack up the Cambro-Ordovician sediments. Thus the Moine Thrust changes its character from place to place. Indeed, the western edge of the Moine outcrop is not everywhere defined by the Moine Thrust. Later thrusts and faults, some associated with much later basin formation characterise the map edge of Moine rocks in much of the Lochcarron area.",

    "Description": "In late Mesozoic times (c. 230–65 million years ago, Ma), that part of the Earth’s crust destined to become ‘Europe’ was affected by compressional forces from the south. The Tethys Ocean which had separated ‘Europe’ from ‘Africa’ through much of Mesozoic time began to narrow as its ocean crust was subducted, and this ocean is now represented by mere remnants of oceanic crust in the eastern Mediterranean area. The Alpine Orogeny is the result of the convergence and collision of ‘Africa’ with ‘Europe’, closing the western part of the Tethys Ocean during the Tertiary Sub-Era (c. 65 to 2 Ma). For further details of the palaeogeography, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=94' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Igneous'>TER-IGN</a>.\r\nThe most obvious features of this episode of Earth history are the European Alps, the result of uplift and compression. In the UK, the effects of the Alpine Orogeny are less obvious than those of the Variscan, the major Alpine collision zone being some 1000 km south of Dorset. However, the knock-on effects of the Alpine Orogeny have formed large structures gently deforming the Mesozoic rocks of the south coast of England, such as the monocline affecting the Isle of Wight and southern Dorset.\r\nAlpine effects in Britain were probably magnified as a result of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean in early Tertiary times. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=94' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tertiary Igneous'>TER-IGN</a>.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of intrusive and extrusive igneous activity in north-west Britain that occurred during Palaeocene and early Eocene times (c. 63–52 Ma) that accompanied continental separation and lithospheric attenuation during the early stages of the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=73' title='Click for details of GCR Block Neogene'>NEO</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Tertiary Igneous rock distribution</h2>\r\nIn Great Britain, volcanism was most vigorous in the Inner Hebrides and adjoining north-west Scotland but also extended to southern Scotland, north-east England and the Outer Hebrides. Intrusions of similar age in North Wales and the English Midlands are probably outlying representatives of contemporaneous activity in north-east Ireland, additional activity in the Bristol Channel centred on Lundy. The region encompassing the activity is known as the British Tertiary Volcanic Province (BTVP) or the British Tertiary Igneous Province (BTIP).\r\nThe varied igneous rocks, together with associated sediments and metamorphic rocks have responded in different ways to the profound erosion of the last fifty million years. Gabbro and peridotite have given rise to the rugged mountain scenery of St Kilda, the Skye Cuillins and Rum. The considerable, but generally less-rugged, mountains of northern Arran and the Skye Red Hills are composed of granite, while the piles of flat-lying lavas form tabular, ‘trap-featured’ hills in northern Skye, rising sometimes to form high mountains, as at Ben More, Mull.\r\n\r\n<h2>Tertiary Igneous activity and petrology</h2>\r\nThe igneous activity took many forms and involved a wide variety of magmas and rock types. The remains of large accumulations of dominantly basaltic lava flows cover extensive areas in Skye and Mull. Laterally extensive swarms of basaltic dykes are most intense near Skye, Rum, Mull, and Arran but extend to the Outer Hebrides, southern Scotland, Cleveland in north Yorkshire and parts of North Wales and central England. Central intrusive complexes consisting of granite, gabbro, peridotite and other rock types occur on a line from Skye to the Bristol Channel and at several places in the north-east Atlantic; these are the deeply-dissected roots of major volcanoes.\r\nVolcanism in the BTVP extended over a period of about eleven million years, largely within the Palaeocene Epoch, apart from the later intrusions within the Eastern Red Hills Centre of Skye, the Sgurr of Eigg pitchstone, the Lundy granite complex and the youngest intrusion in the Mourne Mountains Western Centre, Ireland. The Palaeocene volcanism was preceded by Cretaceous igneous activity in the eastern Atlantic area and it is also possible that the submarine central complex at the Blackstones, south-west of Mull, is Cretaceous in age. Within the BTVP, the life span of individual central complexes was short, of the order of two or three million years (or even less) and the thick lava accumulations built up over even shorter periods.\r\nVolcanic activity in a given area often started with the formation of small amounts of basaltic ash and other volcaniclastic accumulations. These were quickly followed by voluminous subaerial eruptions of basaltic lavas which covered the peneplaned surfaces of older sedimentary and metamorphic rocks ranging in age from the Precambrian to the Cretaceous. Occasionally, the lavas covered landscapes of considerable relief, filling valleys, burying hills and sometimes flowing into shallow lakes, where pillow lavas and hyaloclastites formed. Sedimentary horizons are not common in the lavas, but fluviatile conglomerates, sandstones and fine-grained plant-bearing horizons do occur and provide valuable stratigraphical and palaeogeographical information. The lavas were often subjected to intense weathering between flow extrusion, with the formation of bright red lateritic deposits. With increasing thickness of lavas, heated waters circulating through the flows altered the basalts and deposited distinctive suites of zeolite minerals, for which Skye and Mull are particularly noted.\r\nThe lavas were principally fed from fissure eruptions similar to those of present day Iceland. The actual feeders are among the multitude of dykes forming the swarms which extend across the Province; dykes intrude virtually all intrusions and extrusions in the BTVP, so it is likely that lava effusion also occurred throughout the life span of the Province. However, the thick sequences of lavas now preserved in Mull, Skye, and the Small Isles built up between about 63 Ma and 60 Ma, early in the life of the BTVP. Occasionally, lavas must have been erupted as the central complexes developed; there is good evidence from several centres that silicic and intermediate lavas were closely associated with central complexes but there are few substantiated examples of basaltic lavas, with the exception of pillow lavas within the Mull centre. Not all the (predominantly basaltic) magma reached the surface to form flows, some froze in conduits as dykes and plugs and quite large amounts spread laterally through the Mesozoic sediments beneath the lavas to form the prominent dolerite sills of northern Skye and Arran.\r\nThe central complexes generally post-date the adjoining lavas, but they were intruded by later members of the dyke swarms. Within the complexes the magmatic sequences were rarely straightforward: in Mull early granite intrusions were followed by numerous basaltic, intermediate and acid cone-sheets, by gabbros and peridotites and by further granites; in Skye, the sequence was apparently simpler, the gabbros and peridotites of the Cuillins were cut by numerous basaltic cone-sheets and subsequently by granites of the Red Hills. Thus, the central complexes record varied intrusive sequences in which basaltic and granitic magmas have been intimately associated. Occasionally, it may be shown that contrasted magmas must have coexisted, forming, for example, the composite basalt–quartz–porphyry sheets and dykes of the Province and the complicated intrusion breccias found in Ardnamurchan, Skye and other central complexes.\r\nWithin the central complexes, individual centres of activity are defined by arcuate intrusions – cone-sheets, ring-dykes and stocks – which have a common focus. In most central complexes, and in particular Ardnamurchan, Skye and Mull, the intrusions of one centre may cut those of an earlier one, recording movements in the focus of magmatic activity with time. Ardnamurchan provides an exceptionally clear and often cited example of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe Tertiary igneous activity occurred in geographically well-defined areas which usually include a central volcano and surrounding lavas. These areas have been made the basis of the ‘networks’ for site selection.\r\n•\tIsle of Skye\r\n•\tRum, Eigg, Muck, Canna–Sanday\r\n•\tArdnamurchan\r\n•\tIsle of Mull\r\n•\tIsle of Arran\r\n•\tRockall\r\n•\tSt Kilda\r\n•\tLangbaurgh Ridge and Cliff Ridge",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of Earth history that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma, which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian(417–354 Ma) time, as represented by geological features present in the Lake District; geological structures south of the Southern Upland Fault produced elsewhere by the same events are covered by other Blocks: the Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands and Caledonian Structures of Wales, for both geographical and geological reasons. See the GCR Blocks <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>.Igneous rocks that formed as a result of the Caledonian Orogeny are encompassed by the <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a> GCR Block\r\nThere is at present no agreed definition of the term ‘Caledonian’, but is taken here to include all of the convergent tectonic and magmatic events arising from the closure of the ‘proto-Atlantic’ Iapetus Ocean in which many of the rocks of Late Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic age had been deposited. It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, ‘Baltica’ (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data, which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins. Magma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe generally accepted sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is as follows.\r\n•\tClosure of the Tornquist Sea between Eastern Avalonia and Baltica, followed by strike-slip movement along the Tornquist Suture.\r\n•\tAnticlockwise rotation of Baltica, followed by convergence with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the ‘Scottish’ sector of the Laurentian margin and closure during early to mid-Silurian times.\r\n•\tOblique convergence of Eastern Avalonia with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the Laurentian margin, resulting in closure by the early Silurian in the ‘Irish’ sector and later, mid-Silurian closure in the ‘Scottish’ sector. The junction between the two fused plates passes through the Solway Firth in Britain and is known as the Iapetus Suture.\r\n•\tProtracted continent–continent collision between Laurentia and Eastern Avalonia plus Baltica, with underthrusting beneath part of the Laurentian margin (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n•\tSeparation of a further microcontinent, Armorica, from the margin of Gondwana, which then collided with Eastern Avalonia during Early Devonian times (the Acadian Event).\r\n•\tSinistral re-alignment of terrane boundaries (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n\r\n<h2>The Caledonian Orogenic Belt</h2>\r\nThe Caledonian–Appalachian Orogen can be traced (pre-Atlantic drift), for some 7500 km south-west to north-east, from south-eastern USA through the British Isles to Scandinavia, Greenland, and Ny Friesland. It is generally accepted that sedimentation and igneous activity took place at, or near, the margins of an ocean (the Iapetus) that separated the Laurentian and Gondwanaland plates, over a period from the Precambrian through the early Palaeozoic. From studies of fauna, sedimentary history, igneous activity, structural and metamorphic evolution, and palaeomagnetism on its two sides, it is considered that deformation of sediments and volcanic rocks, resulting from the episodic closure of the Iapetus Ocean, took place through the early Palaeozoic to culminate in continental collision during the early part of the Devonian Period.\r\nThe British Caledonides–Lake District\r\nOn the south-eastern margin, the argument for SE-directed subduction rests largely on the presence of arc volcanism in the Lake District during the Llandeilo or Caradoc epochs. Structural arguments have focused on the nature and significance of the pre- and post-Borrowdale Volcanic Group unconformities, but particular features that could be related directly to subduction have not been identified. Folding in the Skiddaw Group has been re-interpreted as being the product of slumping, and this may prove important with regard to the arguments for the timing of subduction and the topography of the margin. Apart from tilting and block faulting due to volcanotectonic activity, the dominant deformation in the Lake District is regarded as essentially a single event that resulted in folding, cleavage, and greenschist metamorphism during the early Devonian.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 440 to 428 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the first epoch of the the Silurian Period (440 to 410 Ma).\r\nRocks that formed during the Llandovery Epoch form the Llandovery Series (part of the Silurian System). The Silurian System is divided into four series (Llandovery, Wenlock (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=105' title='Click for details of GCR Block Wenlock'>WEN</a>), Ludlow (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>) and Prídolí (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=86' title='Click for details of GCR Block Prídolí'>PRIDOL</a>)) and all but one series (the Pridoli) into a number of stages. The Llandovery Epoch is divided into three ages.\r\nOf the eight stratotypes that define the bases to the Silurian stratigraphical divisions, seven are in Britain. The one exception is the base to the Prídolí Series. The chosen level for the base of the Devonian System in the Czech Republic is considerably higher than the base of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ which had traditionally been regarded as the Silurian–Devonian boundary in the Welsh Borderland. The new Prídolí Series therefore correlates with the lowest part of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>). Graptolites and conodonts have yielded the most refined Silurian zonations, but analogous schemes exist for other groups, notably brachiopods, acritarchs and chitinozoans.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeographical framework</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Suture, trending NE–SW close to the England–Scotland Border, marks the former site of the Iapetus Ocean between Laurentia to the north-west and Avalonia to the south-east. It is helpful to further subdivide these two regions into palaeogeographical areas, each with a distinctive Silurian record of subsidence or uplift, sedimentation or erosion. This subdivision of Britain provides the template against which the network of important stratigraphical sites can be compared.\r\n\r\n<h2>Laurentian elements</h2>\r\nThe Scottish Highlands have their south-eastern limit at the Highland Boundary Fault. Non-marine sedimentary rocks of probable Ludlow and Prídolí age are locally preserved, and late Silurian granitic intrusions imply an original volcanic superstructure. The area probably lacked marine basins, and comprised actively deforming, uplifting and eroding continental crust throughout Silurian time.\r\nThe Scottish Midland Valley is the area between the Highland Boundary Fault and the Southern Uplands Fault. During Silurian time it accumulated shallow marine to non-marine sediments, implying an underlying normal-thickness continental crust.\r\nThe Southern Uplands of Scotland now lie between the Southern Uplands fault and the Iapetus Suture. Their formation is interpreted as a thrust stack of deep-water sediments.\r\n\r\n<h2>Avalonian elements</h2>\r\nThe Midland Platform is the stable core of the Eastern Avalonia continent lying south-east of the Welsh Borderland fault system. During Silurian time it was flooded more persistently by shallow seas but accommodated only modest thicknesses of sediment. In latest Silurian (Prídolí) and Early Devonian time the platform accumulated a thick prism of sediment shed southwards from the newly uplifting areas to the north. The platform was only weakly deformed during the Acadian Orogeny\r\nThe Welsh Basin borders the north-west edge of the Midland Platform, as far as the Menai Strait fault system. Ithosted deep marine environments, and accumulated some kilometres of sediment. In late Ludlow and Prídolí time, the basin shallowed as subsidence gave way to uplift, and by Early Devonian time the former basin was an eroding source area.\r\nThe Anglian Basin had a similar tectonic setting on the north-east side of the Midland Platform. Its rocks are known only from boreholes, but its sedimentary history has the same shallowing upwards character as that of Silurian Wales.\r\nThe Irish Sea Platform is a small elongate area of Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic crust forming the north-west margin of the Welsh Basin. A thin Silurian sequence is preserved on it, but it may have been emergent for much of Silurian time.\r\nThe Lake District Basin is the most northerly component of Avalonian palaeogeography and was probably continuous with the Leinster Basin of Ireland. The uppermost Ordovician and Silurian sequences were built on the eroded remnants of a volcanic arc formed above the south-dipping Ordovician subduction zone beneath Avalonia. This old arc terrane subsided rapidly enough to give deep-marine environments by earliest Silurian (Llandovery) time. Sedimentary environments became shallower during Prídolí time as sediment input exceeded subsidence, and in Early Devonian time the area was uplifted in the culminating events of the Acadian Orogeny.\r\nUntil late Ordovician time, northern and southern Britain had been separated by the wide Iapetus Ocean. Scotland, together with the north and west of Ireland, were part of the south-eastern margin of the major continent of Laurentia, which straddled the equator through much of Early Palaeozoic time. England and Wales, together with south and east Ireland, lay on the smaller continent of Avalonia, which also included parts of mainland Europe to the east and fragments of the maritime states of North America to the west. Avalonia had originated on the northern margin of Gondwana, the major continent straddling the Early Palaeozoic south pole. Avalonia had rifted from Gondwana early in Ordovician time and moved northwards towards Laurentia, the Iapetus Ocean closing ahead of it and the Rheic Ocean opening in its wake. The continent of Baltica had a broadly similar drift history to Avalonia, so that the two continents amalgamated and moved northwards together from Late Ordovician time onwards.\r\nDuring early Silurian (Llandovery) time both Baltica and Avalonia began to impinge on the Laurentian continent. Continental crust started to choke the northward-dipping subduction zone beneath Laurentia, which had formerly subducted only Iapetus oceanic lithosphere. By late-Silurian (Ludlow) time, the last remnant of the Iapetus Ocean had been destroyed and the Laurentian margin was being overthrust onto the British segment of Avalonia. This thrusting and associated crustal compression rapidly obliterated the marine Silurian basins and began to uplift parts of them above sea level. Consequently, marginal marine and non-marine facies dominate the stratigraphical record from latest Silurian (Prídolí) time into the Devonian. The continental collision culminated in strong deformation, uplift and erosion of the basinal sediments during Early and Mid-Devonian time, an event termed the ‘Acadian Orogeny’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeographical elements of Silurian Britain</h2>\r\nEarly to Mid-Llandovery:  Subduction of Iapetus oceanic lithosphere beneath Laurentia continued from Ordovician time. Deep-marine mudstones (Moffat Shale Group) deposited on the oceanic crust were overlain by turbidite sandstones (Gala Group) as the crust neared the trench. Segments of this sedimentary sequence were periodically scraped off the downgoing slab and accreted to the base of the thrust stack on the Laurentian margin. The trench turbidites were supplied in part from the missing southern segment of the Midland Valley, probably including volcanic arc rocks. Farther north, the preserved part of the Midland Valley received clastic debris from both the south and the north, probably in a relatively shallow marine basin. North of the Highland Boundary Fault were the uplands of the Scottish Highlands, possibly cut by active major faults.\r\nThe shallowest parts of Avalonia were still emergent in earliest Silurian time, following the lowering of sea level during the late Ordovician glaciation. On the Midland Platform, the unconformity produced during this regression is overlain by sequences of shallow marine mudstones and limestones, often with transgressive sandstones at the base (e.g. Kenley Grit–Pentamerus Beds–Hughley Shales). The pulsed nature of the transgression is reflected in the diachroneity of the sediments overlying the unconformity, varying up to upper Llandovery (Telychian). In the basinal areas, the same transgression is recorded by a blanket of carbonaceous mudstones, the signature of anoxic bottom waters in a stratified basin during a secundo (greenhouse) climate. In the Welsh Basin this mudstone deposition was punctuated by sandstones and conglomerates transported by turbidity currents from the edge of the Midland Platform.\r\n\r\n<h2>Late Llandovery to Early Ludlow</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus oceanic remnant separating the two halves of Britain seems to have closed diachronously from south-west to north-east during late Llandovery and Wenlock time. This convergence progressively linked the geological histories of Laurentia and Avalonia, and began to restrict the connections between their marine basins and the open ocean system.\r\nOffscraping of deep-marine turbidites at the Laurentian margin continued from late Llandovery (Hawick Group) at least into late Wenlock time (Riccarton Group). Shallow marine environments in the upper Llandovery of the Midland Valley gave way to subaerial alluvial fans in the Wenlock, supplied from the missing terrane to the south. The Scottish Highlands remained an upland area, its north-western part now undergoing strong deformation and granite intrusion.\r\nOn Avalonia, the Midland Platform accumulated a continuous upper Llandovery to Ludlow sequence, dominated by mudstones (e.g. Coalbrookdale Formation). Shorter periods of limestone deposition (Woolhope, Buildwas and Much Wenlock Limestone formations) coincide with postulated lowstands on the eustatic sea-level curve. The Welsh Basin received large volumes of south-west-derived turbidite sand from late Llandovery time onwards, possibly sourced from newly uplifted areas in the Laurentia–Avalonia collision zone. This source area has been termed Prettania. The sediment was accommodated by an episode of crustal stretching and subsidence in the basin.\r\nThe Lake District Basin accumulated mostly mudstones until early Wenlock time (e.g. Brathay Formation), receiving the first substantial turbidite sands into its south-eastern part in the mid-Wenlock. The main influx of sand was not until early Ludlow time (Coniston Group). The signature of flexural subsidence suggests that the Laurentian thrust stack was substantially loading the northern edge of Avalonia by then, and that the Ludlow turbidite fans of the Lake District represent the encroachment of the Southern Uplands fans onto Avalonian crust.\r\nSubstantial intercalations of volcanic rock within lower Silurian sedimentary sequences point to isolated volcanic centres across the southern part of the Midland Platform. These centres neither overlie extinct Ordovician volcanoes, nor have rocks of the same subduction-related composition. The Silurian volcanism seems to represent a weak episode of crustal rifting, of uncertain origin, within Avalonia.\r\n\r\n<h2>Late Ludlow to Prídolí</h2>\r\nAs Avalonia and Laurentia were driven ever more tightly together, the subsidence of most of their marine basins was curtailed, as any crustal extension gave way to shortening. This shortening began to create new uplands, which shed increasing amounts of sediment into the remaining basins. Deep marine environments were replaced by shallow marine and continental conditions. Even the Lake District Basin, whose flexural subsidence was maintained by the load of the advancing Laurentia, was filled to sea level by sediment before the end of Silurian time.\r\nThe former Laurentian margin was cut by many active faults with sinistral strike-slip or thrust displacements. Remnants of non-marine clastic sediments suggest a scatter of small, locally sourced alluvial basins controlled by these faults. These basins occurred in the Scottish Highlands as well as the Midland Valley and on the uplifted remnants of the Southern Uplands thrust stack. Some basins contain substantial thicknesses of lavas, and contemporaneous granitoid intrusions imply further superjacent volcanic piles. Mismatches between clast compositions in alluvial conglomerates and the source areas implied by palaeocurrent data suggest substantial post-Silurian displacement on some Laurentian faults. In particular, the Southern Uplands may have been thrust back over the persistent source area to the south of the Midland Valley at this time.\r\nThe Lake District and Welsh Basins were rapidly filling with sediment and the marine shoreline was moving quickly south-eastward. By the end of the Prídolí, the basins were emerging above sea level and were starting to be eroded themselves. River systems took the sediment southwards to be deposited first in a marginal marine embayment and then on alluvial plains on the site of the old Midland Platform.\r\nThe 30 Ma of Silurian time had seen the total demise of the marine Silurian basins over most of Britain. An extensive sequence of non-marine sediments, the ‘Old Red Sandstone’, was laid down on the newly consolidated continent during Devonian time (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThree criteria have been particularly important in choosing the GCR sites:\r\n•\tThe chronostratigraphical position of rocks at each site.\r\n•\tThe palaeogeographical setting of each site.\r\n•\tThe international importance of each site. The key sites here are the boundary stratotypes of the global chronostratigraphical scheme\r\nFor site selection, the subdivision into palaeogeographical areas, each with a distinctive Silurian record of subsidence or uplift, sedimentation or erosion, was an important consideration. The areas, described above, provide the framework within which stratigraphical sites can be compared.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology</h2>\r\nSilurian times are now known to have been occupied, from the beginning, by representatives of most of the major groups (phyla) of extant marine animals.  From free-swimming fish and cephalopods to sedentary bottom dwelling corals, clams and actively burrowing worms, the Silurian biota has some taxonomic familiarity to us today.  However, there are also many important differences: almost all of the organisms belong to different genera and most belong to extinct family groupings; a significant number of the important marine groups, such as the trilobites, graptolites and conodonts are members of the distinctive and extinct Palaeozoic fauna.  The dominant shelly macro-invertebrates of Silurian times were brachiopods, a relatively uncommon group today, whose habitats have been taken over by the bivalved molluscs.  The main biological ‘innovations’ of the Silurian are associated with the radiation of the fish and the invasion of the land by animals and plants.\r\nThe late Ordovician glaciation, with its lowered sea levels and major changes in ocean circulation, produced a significant marine extinction at that time.  Many invertebrate groups were severely affected but most made fairly rapid recoveries in early Silurian time.  However some, notably the trilobites, never fully recovered.\r\nThe typical Lower Palaeozoic biota includes brachiopods, trilobites, graptolites, cephalopods (important in stratigraphic correlation) conodonts, bivalved molluscs and gastropods, but important microfossils in Silurian strata include acritarchs, chitinozoans, plant spores, scolecodonts, radiolarians and foraminiferans.\r\nAlso important were the sessile, bottom-dwelling invertebrates, of which many secrete preservable siliceous or calcareous skeletons such as the sponges, stromatoporoids, corals and bryozoans.\r\nThe fossil record of arthropods in Silurian times was almost entirely marine, but for the very rare remains of some of the earliest known land-living animals.  The marine forms are dominated by two groups, the extinct trilobites and the crustacean ostracods.  Of lesser biostratigraphic important are numerous other arthropod groups, such as the phyllocarids, xiphosurans, eurypterids, scorpions and myriapods.\r\nThe Silurian fossil record of the echinoderms contains sporadic remains of the main living and extinct groups from the blastoids, cystoids, crinoids, asteroids, holothurians and echinoids to the ophiuroids.\r\nSomewhat like jellyfish in life habits, the graptoloid graptolites (with millimetre wide branches and an overall colony diameter of up to a metre) were, for the most part, free-living animals that probably fed on the plankton and followed its diurnal migration within the surface waters of the oceans. They are an important group stratigraphically.\r\nThe land-plant fossils are, at first glance, unspectacular in that they are generally small (1–4 cm high), carbonized thin stems with simple dichotomous branches, terminated by globular reproductive organs. This plant fossil evidence from the British sites has been of international importance in developing our understanding of early vascular plant evolution. The most commonly preserved plant fossils are their microscopic reproductive spores, which are produced in great numbers.  The abundance, wide dispersal and evolution in morphology of these plant spores has made them very useful biostratigraphical markers and has led to the development of spore-based biozonal schemes.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 161 to 157 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the last Age of the Mid Jurassic Epoch, which spans from 178 to 157 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Callovian Age constitute the Callovian Stage, part of the Middle Jurassic Series, which is in turn part of the Jurassic System. In the past, the Callovian Stage was included in the Upper Jurassic Series because the base of the Callovian approximately co-incides with the end of the carbonate sedimentation that characterises much of the Middle Jurasssic strata; however the Jurassic strata of Germany are now used as the basis of subdivision of the Jurassic System, such that current practice takes the base of the Upper Jurassic Series as the base of the Oxfordian Stage.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcrop pattern</h2>\r\nOn maps showing the solid geology of England, Middle Jurassic rocks crop out in an almost continuous strip from the Dorset coast to the North Yorkshire coast. In Scotland, Middle Jurassic rocks crop out in scattered patches in the islands to the north-west as well as in northern Scotland.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nDuring Early Jurassic times Britain was largely covered by shelf sea, however towards the end of the Epoch there was a significant fall in sea level accompanied by crustal upwarping and vulcanicity in the central North Sea Basin. Consequently, Middle Jurassic rocks reflect a variety of depositional environments including shallow marine, fluvial, deltaic, saltmarsh and coastal lagoon. In addition, limestone and clastic sedimentation (mudstone, siltstone and sandstone) was often widespread.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into five themes or ‘networks’, reflecting depositional setting, which was largely controlled by deep-seated structural features. The networks are:\r\n•\tWessex Basin\r\n•\tCleveland Basin (North Yorkshire sites)\r\n•\tEast Midlands shelf\r\n•\tWorcester Basin and Shelf (Cotswolds sites)\r\n•\tMoray Firth and Hebrides basins.\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe traditional means of subdividing the Jurassic System is by means of ammonites, abundant and diverse nektonic cephalopod molluscs that, because of their rapid evolution, prove to be almost ideal ‘zone fossils’, enabling the correlation and division of the rocks into relative ages by way of a distinct fossil ‘signature’.\r\nThe many different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Mid Jurassic times mean that the fossil record is rich and varied. Invertebrate faunas included simple and compound corals, calcareous sponges and bryozoa, abundant bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, smooth terebratulid and ribbed rhynchonellid brachiopods, gastropods (snails), asteroids (starfish), echinoids (sea urchins) and crinoids (sea lilies). The brachiopods occurred in an abundance that was never repeated on such a scale in later geological times. Microscopic organisms included foraminifera, ostracods and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates and coccolithophorid algae).\r\nLobster- and shrimp-like crustaceans often produced burrows within sediments, preserved as trace fossils.\r\nBelemnites, relatives of the ammonites, were abundant and along with fish were probably the main food of the aquatic reptiles, which were the largest vertebrate animals in the sea. These included ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The fish included both holostean and teleostean bony fishes, and sharks and rays.\r\nOn land, dinosaurs had already become established in Mid Jurassic times; primitive mammals formed a minor but important part of the fauna. Land plants of particular prominence were the gymnosperms, notably conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, ferns and horsetails. Insect life included dragonflies.\r\nIn contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated selection categories, owing to the relative rarity of the fossil material.

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 483 to 460 million years ago (Ma), as represented by the rocks deposited during the second and third epochs of the Ordovician Period (495–440 Ma), which is the second period of the Palaeozoic Era (545 to 251 Ma). Rocks that formed during the Ordovician Period constitute the Ordovician System. Tremadoc and Arenig–Tremadoc boundary sites have their own GCR Blocks. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=100' title='Click for details of GCR Block Tremadoc'>TRE</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>. The former Llandeilo Series (now the Llandeilian Stage of the Llanvirn Series) is also afforded its own GCR Block.  See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>.\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of Britain are essentially of marine origin; freshwater and subaerial deposits have been identified only in settings where volcanic edifices were raised above sea level.  Within the marine setting there are rocks of the widest variety, from sandstones and limestones of the shoreline and shallow shelves to beds that accumulated in deep basins or on the continental slopes.  Transects from shelf to basin are seen in both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and examples of shallow- and deep-water deposits are recognized in both Anglo-Welsh and Scottish areas.\r\nThe traditional series of the Ordovician System are Tremadoc (oldest), Arenig, Llanvirn, Caradoc and Ashgill (youngest).\r\nFor details of Ordovician stratigraphy, palaeogeography, palaeontology and GCR site selection, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=16' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian'>CAM</a>.",

Some mass movements are small scale and gradual (creep), others are large-scale, episodic, and even catastrophic. Nearly 30 sites showing important features of scientific interest associated with landslides are included to represent relict and active types of rock failure such as soil creep, debris avalanches, earth flows, mud flows, rock falls, rock slides, planar and rotational slumps.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Tertiary Reptilia GCR Block represent the British fossil record of terrestrial and aquatic reptiles of the Tertiary sub-Era (which spanned from 65 to 2 million years ago (Ma), and which was preceded by the Mesozoic Era). At the end of the Cretaceous Period (the last Period of the Mesozoic era) there was a major, global mass-extinction event (the ‘K-T’ event [Cretaceous-Tertiary]), and this had a significant effect on the faunas of the time, with approximatley 85% of species becoming extinct. The end of the Tertiary sub-Era is marked by the onset of the ‘Great Ice Age’ (Quaternary Period), thus enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a developing, but characteristic, faunal distinctiveness.\r\nEarlier fossil reptiles are afforded their own GCR Blocks, ‘Permian-Triassic Reptilia’and ‘Jurassic- Cretaceous Reptilia’. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=71' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic Reptilia'>PER-TRI-RP</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=38' title='Click for details of GCR Block Jurassic - Cretaceous Reptilia'>JUR-CRE-RP</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe reptiles evolved from their amphibian forebears over 300 million years ago. The oldest postulated fossil reptile is known from the Carboniferous of Scotland. Reptiles radiated extensively during the Permian Period and the Mesozoic Era, a span of time often referred to as the ‘Age of Reptiles’. Britain’s 500 hundred or more fossil reptile sites provide abundant information on reptiles of this time, including key Triassic sites that document the pre-dinosaur times, and unique dinosaurian faunas of Mid Jurassic and Early Cretaceous age. Marine reptiles (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, crocodilians) are richly represented in the Early and Late Jurassic in particular. A number of Tertiary localities have yielded rich faunas of turtles, crocodilians and squamates. \r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe palaeogeography of each relevant geological period of the Tertiary sub-Era can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website. SeeTER-IGN, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=73' title='Click for details of GCR Block Neogene'>NEO</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nOwing to the rarity of fossil reptile material, this GCR Block represents something of a special case with regard to including all of the sites yielding, or that have yielded, significant types and quantities of scientifically important material that help elucidate the evolution, diversification and extinction of the main reptile groups.\r\nThe sites selected for this Block aim to represent distinct reptile assemblages showing diversification and extinction associated with the Tertiary sub-Era.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 470 to 440 million years ago (Ma), as represented by the rocks deposited during the last two epochs of the Ordovician Period (495–440 Ma), which is the second period of the Palaeozoic Era (545 to 251 Ma). Rocks that formed during the Ordovician Period constitute the Ordovician System.\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of Britain are essentially of marine origin; freshwater and subaerial deposits have been identified only in settings where volcanic edifices were raised above sea level.  Within the marine setting there are rocks of the widest variety, from sandstones and limestones of the shoreline and shallow shelves to beds that accumulated in deep basins or on the continental slopes.  Transects from shelf to basin are seen in both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and examples of shallow- and deep-water deposits are recognized in both Anglo-Welsh and Scottish areas.\r\nThe traditional series of the Ordovician System are Tremadoc (oldest), Arenig, Llanvirn, Caradoc and Ashgill (youngest).\r\nFor details of Ordovician stratigraphy, palaeogeography, palaeontology and GCR site selection, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=16' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian'>CAM</a>.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of intrusive and extrusive igneous activity in Britain that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>), which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian (417–354 Ma) time.\r\nThere is at present no agreed definition of the term ‘Caledonian’, but is taken here to include all of the convergent tectonic and magmatic events arising from the closure of the ‘proto-Atlantic’ Iapetus Ocean in which many of the rocks of Late Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic age had been deposited. It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’. By this definition, most Caledonian igneous rocks of Britain range in age from about 500 Ma (earliest Ordovician) to around 390 Ma (end Early Devonian), with related activity continuing to around 360 Ma (end Late Devonian) in Orkney and Shetland.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and, by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, Baltica (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins.\r\nMagma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe exact sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is the subject of much debate, in which the distribution, nature and timing of the igneous activity are crucial evidence.\r\nThe tectonic history of the Caledonian Orogeny in Britain can be divided into the following time intervals, linking together coeval magmatic events in the various terranes across the whole orogenic belt.\r\n•\tEarly Ordovician –Tremadoc and Arenig\r\n•\tMid-Ordovician –Llanvirn and Llandeilo\r\n•\tLate Ordovician –Caradoc and Ashgill\r\n•\tEarly and mid-Silurian –Llandovery and Wenlock\r\n•\tLate Silurian and Early Devonian –Ludlow to Emsian\r\n•\tMid- and Late Devonian –Eifelian to Famennian\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nWithin this GCR Block, sites fall into natural ‘networks’, which are based upon petrological or tectonic affinites, age and geographical distribution. The ten networks are:\r\n•\tOrdovician Volcanic Rocks and Ophiolites of Scotland\r\n•\tOrdovician intrusions of the NE Grampian Highlands of Scotland\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of the Lake District\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of Central England\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of Wales\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: alkaline ntrusions of the NW highlands of Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: granitic intrusions of Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: northern England\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian volcanic rocks: Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian volcanic rocks: Wales\r\nSites that are important for unravelling the geological history of these major igneous events will also be important for demonstrating general processes of igneous rock petrology, magma evolution and emplacement, and vulcanology (e.g. Cauldron Subsidence theory at Glencoe) irrespective of their role in building up a picture of the sequence of events of geological history of the UK.\r\nWeighting of site selection has focussed on identifying those sites where the contribution of Caledonian igneous rocks of Great Britain to igneous petrology and the understanding of igneous processes and have played a major role in the initiation, testing and evolution of many theories of igneous processes.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Palaeoentomology GCR Block represent the British fossil record of the insects from the emergence of the group during the Devonian Period (which ranged from about 395 to 345 million years ago (Ma)). Other fossil arthropods (except trilobites) are afforded their own GCR Block, ‘Arthropods’. See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=3' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arthropoda'>APD</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nToday, creatures as seemingly diverse as barnacles, beetles, fleas, flies, crabs, trilobtes and woodlice can all be recognised as arthropods and share a unifying body plan –a tough exoskeletal cuticular covering (carapace) to a segmented body and paired jointed legs.\r\nAfter the emergence of the group about 500 Ma, by 400 Ma the arthropods were not only well-established in the marine environment but had made the difficult transition to life on land, and by around 320Ma, the arthropods had already made the transition to the air –the first creatures on Earth to do so. The subsequent success of flying insects had a huge impact of life on land, their ‘hand-in-hand’ evolution with flowering plants n late Mesozoic times led to a tranformation of terrestrial vegetation.\r\nTaxonomically the arthropod group has been recognised since the mid 19th century and includes insects (Devonian–Recent range), crustaceans (Cambrian to Recent), myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), chelicerates (spiders and scoprions), ostracods (Cambrian–Recent), and extinct groups such as trilobites (Cambrian–Permian), and eurpterids (Ordovician–Permian).\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe palaeogeography of each relevant geological period since the Devonian can be found elsewhere on the pages of this website.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nOwing to the rarity of fossil insect material, this GCR Block represents something of a special case with regard to including all of the sites yielding, or that have yielded, significant types and quantities of scientifically important material that help elucidate the evolution of the main insect groups.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 210 to 205 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the last part of the Late Triassic Epoch, which spans from 227 to 205 Ma. Rocks that formed during the Late Triassic Epoch (part of the Triassic Period, 250–205 Ma) constitute the Upper Triassic Series (part of the Triassic System). British rocks of Rhaetian age include the Penarth Group, the formal lithostratigraphical name for rocks formerly called the ‘Rhaetic’ in Britain. However, owing to the formal definition of the Rhaetian Age, British Rhaetian strata include the uppermost part of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group, and the lowermost part of the otherwise Jurassic Lias Group. The main focus of this GCR Block is the Penarth Group sediments.\r\nThe Penarth Group comprises the Westbury Formation and the succeeding Lilstock Formation. The Group represents a dramatic change in sedimentation style throughout the British Isles and much of western and central Europe at the end of the Triassic Period. The mainly continental, red and yellow mudstones and sandstones of the Germanic Keuper and of the Mercia Mudstone Group, come to an abrupt halt, and are succeeded by grey, marine mudstones, limestones, and sporadic, thin, bone beds. This change has long been interpreted as reflecting a major marine transgression that apparently flooded much of north-west and central Europe a few million years before the end of the Triassic Period, a prelude to the marine Lower Jurassic Series (= Lias).\r\nThe change in sedimentary style that marks the onset of the Penarth Group, from red bed to dark-coloured marine sediments, is dramatic, but it is local to central and western Europe, and not a worldwide phenomenon, and it is not associated with major faunal and floral changes. Such changes occur higher in the succession, around the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, as formally defined.\r\nThe Penarth Group is noted for its sharp, unconformable boundary with the underlying Blue Anchor Formation of the Mercia Mudstone Group, probably marking the level at which the Rhaetian sea waters flooded across the playas and brackish sabkhas. Penarth Group sediments are marine, as indicated by their fossil content, including, for example, dinoflagellate cysts, corals, brachiopods, bivalves, echinoderm debris and ichthyosaur bones). The sediments consist predominantly of blue, grey, and black shales and limestones, arranged in laterally extensive, but generally thin, units. Bone beds, units containing abundant transported bones, teeth, coprolites, and phosphatic debris of mixed marine and continental derivation occur in places. A basal bone bed occurs at some locations, but there are in fact ‘Rhaetic’ bone beds at several horizons.\r\nThe Westbury Formation overlies the Blue Anchor Formation, the uppermost unit of the Mercia Mudstone Group, usually unconformably. In many places, a thin, laterally impersistent bone bed, the ‘Rhaetic bone bed’, occurs at the base of the Westbury Formation. The remainder of the formation consists of dark grey mudstones or shales with subordinate thin limestones and sandstones. The overlying Lilstock Formation is bounded above by the base of the ‘Paper Shale’ of the Pre-planorbis beds of the Lower Lias.\r\nThe Pre-planorbis beds and the Triassic–Jurassic boundary\r\nThe position of the Triassic–Jurassic boundary has been a subject of debate for many years.\r\nUp to 1980, the base of the Jurassic System in Britain was traditionally taken to be the base of the Lias Group, the succession of generally grey-coloured mudstones and limestones so characteristic of the Lower Jurassic Series throughout much of Europe. This interpretation placed the boundary at the base of the lithologically defined ‘Blue Lias’, in particular placing the Pre-planorbis Beds in the Jurassic System. However, this characterization of the base of the system in Britain was purely lithological, and a formal, biostratigraphical definition has been placed at the first appearance of the ammonite Psiloceras planorbis, which thereby marks the base of the Hettangian Stage. Therefore the Pre-planorbis beds of the Blue Lias Formation are of Triassic, not Jurassic, age.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe Penarth Group reflects the widespread establishment of marine environments following a transgression that spread northwards through central and north-western Europe into Britain. At the same time, there was major rifting and volcanism in southern Europe, North Africa, and eastern North America, as proto-North Atlantic rifting opened up linear structures parallel to the current coastline of eastern North America, from Nova Scotia where thick lacustrine sediments of the Newark Supergroup accumulated.\r\nThe marine rocks of the Penarth Group succeed the greyish and greenish, dolomitic mudstones of the Blue Anchor Formation, formerly the ‘Tea Green Marls’ and ‘Grey Marls’, the highest formation in the Mercia Mudstone Group. These marine influences in the upper Norian strata in the UK were followed by full-scale marine conditions in the Rhaetian .\r\nThe Penarth Group sediments mark the marine transgression proper. The top of the Blue Anchor Formation is often intensely burrowed, and clasts of Blue Anchor Formation mudstones commonly occur in the basal Westbury Formation. The unconformable base of the Penarth Group is also marked here and there by bone-rich arenaceous units, the ‘Rhaetic bone beds’, and these are overlain by beds containing marine fossils such as oysters, pectinid bivalves, and echinoids.\r\nThe timing of the transgression is unclear in Britain. It appears to have occurred rapidly, perhaps sweeping from the south to the north. After the initial flooding, dark shales of the Westbury Formation accumulated. This facies is typical of the English Penarth Group, and is also seen throughout the region of the transgression, from the Alps to the Baltic area. The black shales throughout this whole area contain a limited fauna, predominantly the bivalve Rhaetavicula contorta, hence the former name of the unit, the ‘contorta Zone’. Rhaetavicula is a specialized epifaunal bivalve that was presumably adapted to unfavourable conditions, particularly anoxic bottom waters, evidenced by the black colour of the shales and by associated pyrite.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Westbury Formation bone beds</h2>\r\nThere are bone beds at several horizons in the Westbury Formation, not just at its base. In all cases the bones are heavily phosphatized and may be in superb and apparently unworn condition, or extensively rolled and abraded. The contrast in styles of preservation is best brought out by a comparison of material from the bone beds at Westbury Garden Cliff, on the north bank of the River Severn, and Aust Cliff, on the south.\r\nIn both cases, bones, spines, teeth, and scales, have been swept in by storm activity of some kind. The remains represent aquatic, and presumably marine, vertebrates for the most part (fishes, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, choristoderes), but there are some unequivocal dinosaur bones. Hence, the bone beds indicate a shallow marine setting, confirmed by the associated trace fossils and shelly fossils. Perhaps the transgressing sea swept over the playas and sabkha plains of the Mercia Mudstone Group, engulfing the remains of dinosaurs and other terrestrial fauna, and mixing them with those of fishes and marine reptiles living in the newly expanding sea.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Lilstock Formation</h2>\r\nThe black shales of the upper part of the Westbury Formation are overlain by grey-green and grey marls of the Cotham Member of the Lilstock Formation..\r\nThe environment in southern England was probably an extensive inhospitable hypersaline tidal flat. Such conditions are indicated by a range of sedimentary structures in the Cotham Member sediments. In places, domal stromatolites have been reported, formed by the growth of cyanobacteria and calcareous sediments, and indicating desiccating saline conditions. Locally, these form the famous landscape Cotham Marble in the Bristol district.\r\nThe Langport Member consists mainly of limestones with dark shales, and indicates a renewal of fully marine conditions. The Langport Member often contains a rich fauna of oysters, pectinid bivalves, echinoids, solitary corals, and trace fossils, all indicative of shallow marine conditions. In Devon, the member is represented by limestones formerly known as the ‘White Lias’.\r\nThe Penarth Group sediments document an apparently rapid marine transgression at the base of the Westbury Formation, followed by shallowing and local exposure as hypersaline tidal flats during Cotham Member times, and a further inundation in the Langport Member times. The sea apparently deepened into Jurassic times.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nPenarth Group sediments have been described from a large number of sites, especially in the south-west of England and South Wales, but also from occurrences in Gloucestershire, Hereford and Worcester, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Cumbria. The goup was also identified in Scotland (Morayshire, Hebrides, Arran) and in Northern Ireland, as well as from boreholes in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the Western Approaches, and in south-east England.\r\nGCR sites on the north and south shores of the Severn Estuary, and on the Dorset coast are selected for the GCR to represent the sedimentary, stratigraphical and palaeontological features of the Penarth Group, according to four regional networks:\r\n•\tSouth Wales\r\n•\tSouth Gloucestershire\r\n•\tNorth Somerset\r\n•\tEast Devon.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nThe fossils of the Penarth Group include a range of predominantly marine forms including foraminifera, corals, annelids, gastropods, bivalves, crustaceans, echinoderms, brachiopods, conodonts, and fishes (sharks, chimaeras, bony fishes, coelacanth), and organic-walled microplankton (dinoflagellate cysts and acritarchs), but also including continental organisms (plants, insects, lungfish, dinosaurs).\r\nFossil fish remains include abundant isolated teeth, dermal denticles, and fine spines (‘ichthyodorulites’) of sharks: Polyacrodus, Lissodus, ‘Hybodus’, Nemacanthus, Palaeospinax, Synechodus, and Vallisia. Rare tooth plates of chimaeroids include the genera Myriacanthus and Agkistracanthus. Bony fishes are represented by teeth, scales, and isolated bones of the actinopterygians Gyrolepis, Birgeria, Severnichthys, and others, a coelacanth, and tooth plates of the lungfish Ceratodus. Amphibians were reported, based on massive teeth with labyrinthine infoldings, and heavy jawbones, but these have been found to belong to the bony fish Severnichthys.\r\nPenarth Group tetrapods are represented mostly by isolated teeth, vertebral centra, limb bones, and occasional ribs. Fossil marine reptiles from the Penarth Group are primarily from the basal bone bed: ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, placodonts, and the choristodere Pachystropheus rhaeticus, a small, superficially crocodile-like animal. Isolated remains of terrestrial reptiles reported from a number of bone-bed sites include the dinosaurs Camelotia and (?) Megalosaurus, and the phytosaur ‘Paleosaurus’. In addition, isolated teeth of mammal-like reptiles and mammals have been noted (the cynodont Tricuspes and the haramiyids Haramiya and Hypsiprimnopsis). These scattered elements of terrestrial animals were presumably washed from landmasses some distance away, and incorporated into the essentially marine bone beds.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 354 to 327 million years ago (Ma) as represented by rocks in Devon and Cornwall. This interval is the first part of the Carboniferous Period, which spans from about 354 to 292 Ma. Rocks that formed during the during Dinantian time constitute the Dinantian Subsystem, which comprises the Tournaisian and Visean series, in turn made up from the Courceyan, Chadian, Arundian, Holkerian, Asbian and Brigantian stages. In the GCR, the Dinantian Subsystem plus Pendleian and Arnsbergian stages (the lowest two stages of the overlying Silesian Subsystem) are equated with Lower Carboniferous (or Mississipian) Subsystem.\r\nThe majority of the stages are defined at stratotype sections, either in northern England, South Wales or southern Ireland, but a stratotype section for the Arnsbergian Stage has yet to be established.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe major features controlling deposition in Britain during Early Carboniferous times owe much to structures inherited from the Caledonian Orogeny.(See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>). Closure of the Iapetus Ocean had led to the development of a suture running ENE–WSW across northern England, with differing Lower Palaeozoic geological histories on either side.The Caledonian structure of England and Wales was strongly influenced by a ‘Midlands Microcraton’ in central England.To the east of this, Caledonian structures trend north-west–south-east, but to the west and north the trend is north-east–south-west.A major feature of the palaeogeography of Britain during Early Carboniferous times is the land area of the Wales–Brabant Massif, formerly known as St George’s Land, which is, at least in part, a remnant of this Midlands Microcraton.\r\nMajor collision was taking place through Central Europe during the Early Carboniferous Subperiod as a result of closure of the Rheic Ocean, but to the north of this, in Britain, extensional tectonics prevailed.An overall north–south stretching is envisaged, although east–west tension has also been suggested.In England and Wales north of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the combination of (probable) north–south extension combined with the inherited Caledonian structures led to the development of asymmetric grabens with relative subsidence partly controlled by the position of low-density granite plutons.Rifting was pulsed, with particularly active episodes in Chadian–early Arundian and in mid–late Asbian times.Significant rifting also took place during Courceyan times.\r\nAreas undergoing slow subsidence and thus accommodating a relatively thin Lower Carboniferous succession have been variously called ‘blocks’, ‘highs’, ‘horsts’, ‘shelves’ or ‘platforms’, and the areas undergoing more rapid subsidence as ‘basins’, ‘troughs’, ‘gulfs’ or ‘lows’.\r\nSouth of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the Culm Trough and the shelf area bordering it are remnants of a back-arc basin relating to northwards subduction and closure of the Rheic Ocean.In Scotland, between the Grampian Mountains to the north and the Southern Uplands to the south, a major rift, the Midland Valley, formed, controlled by movements on inherited Caledonian faults.\r\nIn late Dinantian times, uplift of source areas led to southwards progradation of a giant clastic delta complex which rapidly filled the basinal areas.At this time, active rifting largely ceased and subsidence in Namurian and Westphalian times was regional and thermally driven.\r\nThe final closure of the Rheic Ocean led to the ‘Variscan’ or ‘Hercynian Orogeny’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>) during late Westphalian and Permian times.South of the Wales–Brabant Massif, compression resulted in thrust faulting and nappe emplacement.In northern Britain, inversion of Lower Carboniferous half-graben and subsequent erosion led to the development of a Permian–Carboniferous angular unconformity.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the Dinantian stratigraphy of Britain sites were selected according to palaeogeographically defined GCR Blocks.\r\n•\tDinantian of Scotland – Midland Valley Basin\r\n•\tDinantian of northern England and North Wales – Northumberland Trough; Lake District and Alston Blocks; Stainmore Basin and Askrigg Block; Craven Basin; Derbyshire Platform, North Staffordshire Basin and the Hathern Shelf; and North Wales Shelf;\r\n•\tDinantian of southern England and South Wales – South Wales–Mendip Shelf\r\n•\tDinantian of Devon and Cornwall\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nIn the early 20th century the first coral–brachiopod zonation schemes for the British Lower Carboniferous sequence were established; subsequently a proliferation of biostratigraphical schemes for the Lower Carboniferous successions of north-west Europe has evolved based principally on the distribution of miospores, conodonts, foraminifera and ammonoids.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Aves [birds] GCR Block represent the British fossil record of Aves from the emergence of the group in the Jurassic Period (which ranged from about 200 to 130 million years ago (Ma)), through the remainder of Mesozoic Era (ending 65 Ma) and through the Tertiary sub-Era (65–1.81 Ma).  Important British fossil bird sites of the Pleistocene Epoch are encompassed by the Pleistocene Vertebrata GCR Block.  See <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=68' title='Click for details of GCR Block Pleistocene Vertebrata'>PCN-VTB</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nIt seems likely that birds are a subgroup of Dinosauria, with closest relatives being modest-sized theropod dinosaurs such as the dromaeosaurids and troodontids, forms with bulbous heads, good eyesight and elongate forelimbs. The evidence for this proposed relationship is extensive and focuses on cladistic analysis of character information on skeletal structures in the forelimb, pelvis, hindlimb and skull. The main alternative view, that birds evolved in the Triassic Period directly from basal archosaur reptiles is not yet supported by evidence.\r\nThe oldest fossil bird is Archaeopteryx, from the late Jurassic Period of Germany, although an older, controversial form, Protoavis, from late Triassic deposits of Texas, has been proposed.\r\nThe phylogeny of birds is not yet fully established. Cladistic studies of the fossils of different ages, where a search is made for shared derived characters (those that uniquely link groups together), show that the majority of Mesozoic birds formed side branches from the line to modern birds (Neornithes). Whereas Archaeopteryx retains primitive reptilian characters, such as teeth, separate fingers with claws on its forelimb, an unfused wrist, a low sternum, an unfused lower leg and ankle and a long bony tail, modern birds lack all these structures. Cretaceous fossils record the loss of these primitive features and the acquisition of ‘modern bird’ characters. Modern birds radiated in the latest part of the Cretaceous Period (140–65 Ma) and divided in the Tertiary sub-Era (65–2 Ma) into around 20 main lineages. Fossils of most of the orders are known from at least the Eocene Epoch, some 50 Ma, especially from the British sites in the London Clay Formation.\r\nAn evolutionary tree of birds shows how a number of small groups branched off in the Cretaceous Period, and one of them, the Enantiornithes, became relatively abundant and diverse. However, the Enantiornithes, and the others, disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous Period, and the Neornithes prevailed thereafter. Most neornithine orders remained at low diversity in the early Tertiary Period and built up to modern diversities during mid- and late Tertiary times. The main change in the Tertiary Period was the huge radiation of the perching birds or songbirds – the Passeriformes – from the Miocene Epoch onwards. Today, the songbirds make up about half the overall diversity of some 7000 living bird species.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Mesozoic (post-Jurassic) and Cainozoic times are summarised on the following pages:\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=4' title='Click for details of GCR Block Aptian-Albian'>APT-ALB</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=9' title='Click for details of GCR Block Berriasian, Valanginian, Hauterivian, Barremian'>BER-BAR</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=72' title='Click for details of GCR Block Palaeogene'>PGN</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=73' title='Click for details of GCR Block Neogene'>NEO</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nOwing to the rarity of fossil bird material, this GCR Block represents something of a special case with regard to including all of the sites yielding, or that have yielded, significant types and quantities of scientifically important material that help elucidate the evolution of birds.\r\nFossil birds are much less well-represented compared to fossil mammals, with equivocal Mesozoic remains and good materials from the early Tertiary Period and the Pleistocene Epoch, but with a Miocene–Pliocene gap.Although some Mesozoic birds have been reported from Great Britain, most have turned out to be equivocal, and the valid reports are relatively unimportant finds, so no GCR sites for Mesozoic birds could be established.For example, supposed bird remains have been described from the Cambridge Greensand (Albian–Cenomanian) of Cambridge – isolated limb elements named Enaliornis barretti and E. sedgwicki.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 423 to 419 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the third epoch of the the Silurian Period (440 to 410 Ma).\r\nRocks that formed during the Ludlow Epoch form the the Ludlow Series (part of the Silurian System). The Silurian System is divided into four series (Llandovery (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>), Wenlock (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=105' title='Click for details of GCR Block Wenlock'>WEN</a>), Ludlow and Prídolí (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=86' title='Click for details of GCR Block Prídolí'>PRIDOL</a>)) and all but one series (the Pridoli) into a number of stages. The Ludlow Epoch is divided into two ages.\r\nOf the eight stratotypes that define the bases to the Silurian stratigraphical divisions, seven are in Britain. The one exception is the base to the Prídolí Series. The chosen level for the base of the Devonian System in the Czech Republic is considerably higher than the base of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ which had traditionally been regarded as the Silurian–Devonian boundary in the Welsh Borderland. The new Prídolí Series therefore correlates with the lowest part of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>). Graptolites and conodonts have yielded the most refined Silurian zonations, but analogous schemes exist for other groups, notably brachiopods, acritarchs and chitinozoans.\r\nFor discussion of Silurian palaeogeography and palaeontology, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent the British geological record of Earth history from about 419 to 417 million years ago (Ma). This interval is the last epoch of the the Silurian Period (440 to 410 Ma).\r\nRocks that formed during the Prídolí Epoch form the Pridoli Series (part of the Silurian System). The Silurian System is divided into four series (Llandovery (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>), Wenlock (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=105' title='Click for details of GCR Block Wenlock'>WEN</a>), Ludlow (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>) and Pridoli) and all but the Pridoli series is divided into stages. Of the eight stratotypes that define the bases to the Silurian stratigraphical divisions, seven are in Britain. The one exception is the base to the Prídolí Series. The chosen level for the base of the Devonian System in the Czech Republic is considerably higher than the base of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ which had traditionally been regarded as the Silurian–Devonian boundary in the Welsh Borderland. The new Prídolí Series therefore correlates with the lowest part of the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>). Graptolites and conodonts have yielded the most refined Silurian zonations, but analogous schemes exist for other groups, notably brachiopods, acritarchs and chitinozoans.\r\nFor discussion of Silurian palaeogeography and palaeontology see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants, and rare, enigmatic Precambrian fossil impressions, referred to the world-famous Ediacaran faunal assemblage do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for Precambian Palaeontology GCR Block represent the British fossil record up to the beginning of the Palaeozoic Era, which began about 543 million years ago (Ma). ‘Precambrian’ is a broadly used term for rocks that pre-date the Cambrian Period, i.e. were formed before the Phanerozoic Eon. It encompasses such a vast span of time, extending back to at least 4000 Ma, and has been subdivided into two Eons, the Archaean and the younger Proterozoic Eon. The fossiliferous Precambrian rocks selected for this block belong to the latter, specifically to its youngest part, which has been given the chronological term ‘Neoproterozoic’.\r\nIn British rocks, the beginning of Cambrian time is commonly marked by a widespread unconformity, and also marked by what is often considered to be the onset of the appearance of small shelly fossils, which here therefore marks the end of the ‘Neoproterozoic’.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nPalaeontologists had long been perplexed by the major faunal break at the base of the Cambrian Period, and the Precambrian rocks below were regarded as non-fossiliferous. There was, however, a general recognition that the early Cambrian faunas which are very diverse and of sudden and cosmopolitan appearance, must have had Precambrian ancestors. There were undoubtedly large areas of late Precambrian sedimentary rocks that appeared to have suffered no high degree of subsequent metamorphism, but they proved to be always unfossiliferous. The first Precambrian fossils to gain credence as truly organic in origin were stromatolites, now recognized as structures produced by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). These were found in considerable numbers in the Proterozoic rocks of the Canadian Shield and subsequently in other areas of the world, but there was little if any trace of remains that could be ascribed to animals. In fact when the first Precambrian animal fossils were found, they were initially dismissed as pseudofossils by most palaeontologists.\r\nThe most widely known Precambrian animal fossils are those that later came to be known as constituting the original Ediacaran Fauna. The first fossils were found in the Ediacara Hills in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia.\r\nOne of the next areas to yield Precambrian fossils was Charnwood Forest, Leicestershire, where a frondose impression was discovered in 1957. Precambrian rocks of other areas of the world also began to yield fossils and faunas were recorded from Sweden, the Ukraine, Siberia and Newfoundland. Faunas discovered in the White Sea area of northern Russia included several species in common with Ediacara. The discovery of an Ediacaran fauna in South Wales appears to be unique in that it was the Ediacaran fossils that proved the Precambrian age of the rocks, which had been mapped by the Geological Survey as of early Ordovician age.\r\nBy the late 1970s knowledge of Ediacaran faunas was extensive and with it came recognition that this was a cosmopolitan fauna that had existed shortly before the ‘Cambrian explosion’. No biozones have been erected for these fossils, although there appear to be some differences between the ‘early’ faunas of Wales and Newfoundland, and the ‘late’ faunas of the White Sea and Ediacara which contain a greater diversity of forms. Differences between the Charnwood Forest Precambrian faunas and those found worldwide are discussed later in this chapter. With the renewed interest in early Cambrian fossils there arose the question of the relationship between Ediacaran animals and Cambrian forms. The Ediacaran fauna can be regarded as a sample of Neoproterozoic biodiversity. Despite this extension of Ediacaran faunas into the Cambrian (e.g. the Burgess Shale), it is not always possible to construct evolutionary paths, linking them to Cambrian organisms.\r\nExamination of the organizational level of the Ediacaran fauna leaves no doubts that there must have been earlier animals. Reliable dates of the Ediacaran faunas are few, but include 565 ± 3 Ma (Benus 1988) from Newfoundland down to younger than 543 ± 1 Ma from southern Namibia. We thus have a range of some 22 Ma virtually up to the base of the Cambrian, with the more complex Ediacaran assemblages believed to all lie close to the latter date. Several earlier Precambrian animal fossils have been occasionally recorded from various localities world-wide, but on investigation these have thus far mainly proved to be either incorrectly dated animal remains, or to be inorganic. However, predictions of the divergence of animal phyla based on the evidence of molecular work (e.g. Knoll, 1994) suggest that this may date back to 1000 Ma. This date is appropriate too, as it coincides with a decline in stromatolite diversity that is widely attributed to the effects of extensive metazoan grazing\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe different depositional environments that developed in Britain during Precambrian times are summarised on <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=88' title='Click for details of GCR Block Precambrian of England & Wales'>PRE-EG-WL</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nAll of the Precambrian fossils known from England and Wales are from the upper part of the Neoproterozoic. When one considers the scale of the outcrops of the Precambrian rocks of England and Wales and the generally poor exposure of the rocks in inland outcrop, it is perhaps remarkable that three areas have yielded Precambrian fossils, and these from both shallow- and deep-water environments.",

    "Description": "In contrast to the manner in which most invertebrate fossils are represented in the GCR, fossils of vertebrates, arthropods (except trilobites) and terrestrial plants do have their own dedicated GCR Blocks, because of the relative rarity of the fossil material. The GCR sites selected for the Carboniferous-Permian Fish/‘Amphibia’ GCR Block represent the British fossil record of fishes and stem Tetrapoda and Amphibia of the last two periods of the Palaeozoic Era, from about 354 to 251 million years ago (Ma). At the end of the Devonian Period (preceding the Carboniferous Period) and at the end of the Permian Period (= end of Palaeozoic Era) significant, global, mass extinctions took place, enabling this ‘unit’ of the fossil record to have a characteristic faunal distinctiveness.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontological characteristics</h2>\r\nThe term ‘fishes’, unlike ‘mammals’ or ‘birds’ includes a range for aquatic vertebrates across several taxonomic classes. It refers to the living bony fishes (the teleosts) and cartilaginous sharks, rays and skates (the chondrichthyans), as well as a number of surviving representatives of older groups that were much more common in the past, such as the coelacanths, dipnoans (lungfishes), myxinoids (hagfishes) and petromyzontids (lampreys). The hagfishes and lampreys are jawless (agnathan) fishes. There are also two other groups of ‘fish-like’ aquatic chordates, which are not strictly ‘fishes’. These are the living lancelets (cephalochordates) and the extinct conodonts, which are both important for understanding fish evolution and are considered within this GCR Block.\r\nFollowing the appearance of fishes in Ordovician-Silurian times (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=93' title='Click for details of GCR Block Silurian - Devonian Chordata'>SIL-DEV-CH</a>), when the group were entirely marine, non-marine environments are represented in British Devonian rocks. The Devonian Period had been unmistakably an ‘Age of Fishes’ with its proliferation of species in the marine realm and the entry into fresh waters on all continents. In Carboniferous and Permian times the record is for both marine and non-marine forms. In Carboniferous time ray-finned fishes emerge as the dominant group; in the Permian Period, the fish faunas are dominated by sharks as well as ray-finned fishes.\r\nThe end-Devonian mass-extinction event (c. 354 Ma) involved the total demise of all the older groups of agnathans. Only the myxinoids (hagfishes), lampreys and most of the gnathostomes survived. The disappearance of so many vertebrate types made way for the gnathostomes, in particular, to radiate and expand the group.\r\nThe end-Permian mass extinction event (c. 251 Ma) led to a burst of evolution and diversification in the Cenozoic Era comparable to the Devonian radiation.\r\nAs well as displaying the evolution of fossil fishes during Carboniferous and Permian time, Britain continues to yield invaluable material that helps eluidicate the origins and early evolution of tetrapods; the localities yielding important ‘Amphibia’ material are few in number, but are also globally rare. The first tetrapods entered the stratigraphical record in Late Devonian times; there are bones and teeth and their footprints from well before that period was ended.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeogeography</h2>\r\nThe different depositional environments that developed in Britain during late Palaeozoic times are summarised on the following pages:\r\nSee <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=26' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Devon & Cornwall'>DIN-DV-CW</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=27' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Northern England & North Wales'>DIN-N-E-WL</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=28' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Southern England & South Wales'>DIN-S-E-WL</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=29' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dinantian of Scotland'>DIN-SC</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=46' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Permian'>MAR-PER</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=59' title='Click for details of GCR Block Namurian of England & Wales'>NAM-E-WL</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=70' title='Click for details of GCR Block Permian - Triassic'>PER-TRI</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the purposes of site evaluation and selection, the GCR sites can be grouped into three principal themes or ‘networks’:\r\n•\tBritish Carboniferous fossil fishes\r\n•\tBritish Permian fossil fishes\r\n•\tBritish Carboniferous-Permian stem Tetrapoda and Amphibia\r\nWithin the overall rationale of the GCR, sites were assesed with the following weightings in mind:\r\n•\tsites of international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material.\r\n•\tsites yielding an assemblage (number and variety) of species that are signficant to the understanding of early vertebrates\r\n•\tsites where the fossils are exceptionally well preserved, showing features not seen elsewhere\r\n•\tbest-available sites for major fish/early tetrapod–amphibia assemblages necessary to represent evolutionary succession\r\n•\tsites with particular significance to science and history of palaeontology in the development of studies of early vertebrates\r\n•\tsites enabling the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns.\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\nThe most striking feature of the Scottish landscape is the wide variety of landforms represented in a relatively small geographical area. The rugged Highlands with their accentuated relief contrast with the surrounding lowlands and the more rolling hills of the Southern Uplands and the Midland Valley. Further variety is introduced in the distinctive landscapes of the western and northern island groups and in the rich diversity of scenery around Scotland’s coasts. The present-day landscape is the product of a long history of evolution which reflects the interaction of geology, topography, climate, geomorphological processes and their changes through time. The study of the evolution of the modern Scottish environment during the Quaternary Period has revealed a sequence of events that range from the shaping of many of the major elements of the landscape by glacial erosion to the establishment of the present vegetation cover after the last period of glaciation.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of Scotland. Sites important for fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nFor Scotland, the sites can be grouped into the following areas:\r\n•\tthe Shetland Islands\r\n•\tthe Orkney Islands\r\n•\tCaithness\r\n•\tNorth-west Highlands\r\n•\tInverness area\r\n•\tNorth-east Scotland\r\n•\tEastern Grampian Mountains\r\n•\tSouth-west Highlands\r\n•\tInner Hebrides\r\n•\tOuter Hebrides\r\n•\tWestern Highland Boundary\r\n•\tEastern Highland Boundary\r\n•\tFife and lower Tay\r\n•\tWestern Central Lowlands\r\n•\tLothians and Borders\r\n•\tSouth-west Scotland\r\nFor Scotland, the sites are selected to represent the following networks:\r\n•\tpre-glacial landform inheritance\r\n•\tglacial erosion features\r\n•\tglacial deposits\r\n•\tperiglacial deposits\r\n•\tthe Late Devensian glaciation\r\n•\tthe Late Glacial Interstadial\r\n•\tthe Loch Lomond Stadial\r\n•\tHolocene climate, vegetation and sea-level change.",

    "Name": "Coastal Geomorphology of Scotland",
    "Description": "This GCR Block encompasses coastal landforms and geomorphology as developed in Scotland. Many factors interplay to create the changing face of the coast that we see today: geology, glaciation, sea-level change, sediment supply, wind, wave, tide, and, increasingly, human activities.\r\nOne of the characteristics of the coastline of Great Britain is its state of continual change. Such geomorphological change may be slow and gradual, such as that which occurs where the geological inheritance has produced a resistant rocky coast, or it may also be extremely rapid, such as the almost instantaneous erosional impact of storm waves on a sand beach\r\n\r\n<h2>The geological background</h2>\r\nThe pattern of geological outcrops along the British coast has a fundamental control on the character of the coastline. Broad connections between outcrop pattern and the outline of the coast can be traced, and local geological variations control the detailed pattern of coastal form at local levels. Thus while there are differences between the older and generally far more resistant rocks of northern and western Britain and the younger and weaker rocks found in east and southern England, within each of these zones local contrasts dominate the coastal geomorphology.\r\n\r\n<h2>Geological influence on sediment supply into the coastal system</h2>\r\nA further influence of geology on coastal geomorphology is in the provision of sediment – from offshore as well as from retreating cliffs – that can be incorporated into beaches. Boulders and coarse gravel are derived from erosion of resistant rocks in areas such as Scotland and parts of the Welsh coast; flints form the commonest pebbles and cobbles on beaches in the south of England. Many ‘shingle’ (gravel) beaches have been built from offshore gravels, swept ashore as sea level rose during the Holocene marine transgression, and former sea-floor sediment has contributed to many beaches elsewhere. In places, flints are derived from erosion of the Chalk in which they occur. Farther north in England, a large proportion of the gravel has been eroded from glacial gravels and till cropping out along the coast or offshore.\r\nIn Scotland and Wales, by far the greatest source of gravel and sediment has been derived from glaciogenic sources, deposited both inland and on the adjacent shelf by either glaciers or glacial meltwater. As a result, the sediments are as varied as the rocks that were originally eroded by ice.\r\nSome coarse sediments are brought to the coast by rivers, especially in Scotland and Wales, where gradients are steep and coarse-grained material is readily transported by floods. In contrast, very little sediment other than mud (clay and silt) is now brought down the rivers of lowland Britain to the coast.\r\n\r\n<h2>The coastal marine environment: tides, waves, surges and currents</h2>\r\nIn global terms, the British Isles have unusually high tides and unusually stormy conditions; thus they have a very dynamic coast, one of the reasons why British coastal research has made such an important contribution to the world literature.\r\nHowever, each of these influences also varies greatly around Great Britain. Tidal range is highest at the head of inlets such as the Bristol Channel, and lowest on the English Channel coast between Start Point and Portsmouth, on the East Anglian coast within the North Sea, Cardigan Bay in Wales, and in Shetland in Scotland. Wave energy is highest on coasts exposed to the strong winds of western Britain and the North Atlantic swell; it is lower in such relatively sheltered areas as the Irish Sea and the North Sea. Given its western exposure to the Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel coast tends to fall into an intermediate category.\r\nBoth tidal movements and the advance of waves into shallow water create currents and these move sediment in the nearshore zone, shaping sandbanks, which in turn can affect the local conditions, for example, by forcing larger waves to break and so lose energy as they touch bottom on submerged banks, or even to break against them at low tide. In constricted bedrock channels, perhaps the best example is the Pentland Firth, the tides create extremely strong currents, and where they are channelled between sandbanks as in the Thames estuary or off Great Yarmouth, the patterns of ebb and flow (often dominating different channels) run much faster than in the open sea.\r\nTidal range has an effect on coastal landforms. Barrier beaches, behind which saltmarshes form, tend to be restricted to areas with relatively low tidal range, such as the north Norfolk coast. Such areas also have spits, which in some cases grow to many kilometres in length, for example, Blakeney Point and Orfordness.\r\nHigh tidal-ranges can occur towards the head of estuaries (or Firths in Scotland), and here saltmarshes also develop, though compared with areas of low tidal range they are generally steeper and show much stronger zonation of vegetation, such as in the Bristol Channel–Severn estuary.\r\nThe waves reaching the coast are mainly generated by winds offshore. In the case of the semi-enclosed seas of the Irish Sea and the North Sea, most waves are generated by winds blowing across relatively restricted fetches, and so have a short wave-length, short period, and are relatively steep. Thus along the coasts of these seas, the varying pattern of length of fetch is an important control over wave energies from all directions offshore as well as the frequency with which winds blow from any one direction.\r\nIn the North Sea waves from a northerly direction are generally the largest, with a secondary maximum in East Anglia for waves from the south-east. In the Irish Sea, a west-facing beach like Blackpool, Lancashire, gets its largest waves from a westerly direction, but these are always short-period waves and so put rather small volumes of water onto the beach as they break. As a result, the wide, sandy beach at Blackpool generally consists of a series of ridges and intervening runnels; the seaward slopes of the ridges may be in equilibrium with the short-period waves.\r\nLocally on the North Sea coast, ridge-and-runnel beaches are found in the shelter of a headland, limiting waves reaching the beach to those from the east or south-east; an example is in Bridlington Bay, which is protected from the larger northerly waves by Flamborough Head, Yorkshire.\r\nOn those parts of coast exposed to North Atlantic storm and swell waves, energies are much higher and the long-period waves put large volumes of water onto the beach as they break. Thus such wave conditions often produce very wide beaches with a gentle slope, for example Rhossili in South Wales, the beaches of the Western Isles and in some of the more exposed Cornish bays. Where strong regional winds build large waves, energies are very high, but it is also possible for long-period swell generated far offshore, even in the South Atlantic, to reach the western beaches. Such swell loses height as it moves across the ocean, but it can be distinguished by its typically long period. Beaches exposed to the Atlantic Ocean tend to be dominated by the high energies associated with longperiod waves, even where the exposure is indirect and the waves reach the coast after refraction.\r\nHigh wave-energies can cause considerable erosion even of resistant rocks, and will exploit structural weaknesses such as faults, joints and bedding planes. Narrow inlets, caves, stacks and natural arches are found along our higher-energy coasts even in the most resistant rocks. Good examples of such forms, eroded into resistant lithologies, are found almost everywhere on the islands of the St Kilda group and in the Shetland Islands, such as Foula and Papa Stour. They can also be found in weaker rocks where wave energies are lower, for example, the Chalk cliffs of Thanet, Kent. Waves are also responsible for the longshore drift of sediment along the coast.\r\n\r\n<h2>Coastal sediment transport</h2>\r\nThe alongshore transport of sediment (littoral or longshore drift) is achieved by waves and the currents they induce within the breaker zone. In England particularly, the widespread construction of groynes, revetments and walls has interfered with coastal sediment movement and the coastal sediment balance.\r\nThe direction is determined largely by the angle of wave approach, i.e. it is related to the dominant fetch. Thus the general direction of transport is southwards on the eastern coast of England, and eastwards on the Channel coast.\r\nIn the northern North Sea, the pattern is westward movement along the Moray Firth and mainly southward movement along the Aberdeenshire and Angus coast. The pattern around the Irish Sea is a little more complicated since it is not open to the north as is the North Sea.\r\n\r\n<h2>Sea-Level History</h2>\r\nAt the time of the last glacial maximum, some 18 000 years ago, the abstraction of water from the oceans to build the great land-based ice caps reduced global sea level to some 120–140 m below that of the present day.By the beginning of the Holocene Epoch, 10 000 years before present (BP), sea level was some 40 m below present, and as it continued to rise (the Holocene marine transgression) was within 10 m of its present stand at about 5000 years ago, and close to present level by 4000 years BP. However, the precise changes at any one site will depart from this pattern for many reasons, including crustal stability (tectonic changes, the effects of loading or removal of load by ice sheets and the oceans themselves, local sedimentation) and tidal changes as the coastal configuration has changed, as well as many other lesser effects that may lead to local departures from the general pattern of sea-level rise.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe GCR site-selection exercise for coastal geomorphology followed four categories (‘GCR Blocks’), one for each of England, Scotland and Wales and one for ‘Saltmarsh Geomorphology’; although three of the ‘Blocks’ are country based, comparisons were made to ensure that certain types of site occurring in each were not over-represented in a Great Britain-wide context.\r\nIn some cases, ‘representative’ sites were selected for the GCR as part of a group of related sites. Such a group of sites may show different aspects of one type of phenomenon, which shows significant regional variations in its characteristics, for example, sites with similar landforms have been selected from areas having different tidal ranges.\r\nMost of the GCR sites are dominated by one coastal landform, especially in terms of their associated research significance. However, the selected GCR sites include a number that are complex in their assemblage of linked geomorphological forms, and so they have been classified as ‘Coastal Assemblages’.\r\nThe geomorphology of the coastline is controlled by a complex interaction of factors – the dynamics of the coastal ‘cell’, geological controls (e.g. rock type and structures), the Pleistocene inheritance (isostatic and eustatic effects), sediment ‘budget’, tidal regimes as well as anthropogenic influence. It is the intention within the ‘representativeness’ rationale of the GCR to be able to demonstrate the interplay of these themes and their manifestations from the evidence present in the selected GCR sites. These themes can be thought of as providing a basis for GCR Networks, which link clusters of representative sites.\r\nUltimately, some 26 networks were identified for the GCR project.\r\nA. Cliffed coasts\r\n1. Large-scale structural control: longitudinal and transverse coasts\r\n2. Small-scale structural control: caves, arches, stacks, geos, zawns\r\n3. Cliff forms and processes: plunging cliffs, slope-over-wall, hog’s back, variety of rates of cliff retreat, differential erosion\r\n4. Exhumed and emerged forms: cliffs, benches\r\n5. Karstic development\r\nB. Shore platforms (including both contemporary and emerged features)\r\n6. Structurally controlled\r\n7. Erosionally dominated\r\nC. Beaches and intertidal sediments\r\n8. Beach orientation: relation to wave direction, swell-dominated beaches\r\n9. Beaches undergoing erosion\r\n10. Prograding beaches\r\n11. Beach phases\r\n12. Pre-existing sediment sources, including pre-existing clasts\r\n13. Emerged (‘raised’) beaches\r\n14. Cliff-foot beaches\r\n15. Dunes: rock-based, gravel-based, restricted sources, sand plains\r\n16. Spits\r\n17. Barrier beaches\r\n18. Cuspate forelands and nesses\r\n19. Tombolos and tied islands\r\n20. Intertidal sediments\r\n21. Mudflats, ridge and runnel forms\r\n22. Saltmarsh morphology – creeks, saltpans, piping\r\n23. Machair\r\nD. Coastal valleys\r\n24. Chines, truncated valleys, coastal waterfalls\r\nE. Inlets and submerged coasts\r\n25. Fjords, rias, estuaries\r\nF. Semi-enclosed bays\r\n26. Restricted sediment sources and transfers, submarine barriers, sediment sorting\r\nClearly, any one site may be helpful in elucidating several of these themes and therefore may contribute to more than one GCR Network (for example, Culbin, on the Moray Firth, provides information on sea-level change as well as gravel delivery data over the Holocene Epoch at a site characterized by well-developed dunes situated on top of spit structures).\r\nThe GCR sites encompassed by this GCR Block exclude major coastal landslides, such as Folkestone Warren; which are covered by the Mass Movements GCR Block.Also, sites that are of interest for coastal features that are particularly important for elucidating the Pleistocene history of Britain are described in the Quaternary GCR Blocks.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of Earth history that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma, which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian (417–354 Ma) time, as represented by geological features present in Shetland; geological structures produced elsewhere by the same events are covered by other Blocks: the Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands, Caledonian Structures of the Lake District and Caledonian Structures of Wales, for both geographical and geological reasons.

It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, ‘Baltica’ (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data, which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins. Magma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe generally accepted sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is as follows.\r\n•\tClosure of the Tornquist Sea between Eastern Avalonia and Baltica, followed by strike-slip movement along the Tornquist Suture.\r\n•\tAnticlockwise rotation of Baltica, followed by convergence with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the ‘Scottish’ sector of the Laurentian margin and closure during early to mid-Silurian times.\r\n•\tOblique convergence of Eastern Avalonia with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the Laurentian margin, resulting in closure by the early Silurian in the ‘Irish’ sector and later, mid-Silurian closure in the ‘Scottish’ sector. The junction between the two fused plates passes through the Solway Firth in Britain and is known as the Iapetus Suture.\r\n•\tProtracted continent–continent collision between Laurentia and Eastern Avalonia plus Baltica, with underthrusting beneath part of the Laurentian margin (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n•\tSeparation of a further microcontinent, Armorica, from the margin of Gondwana, which then collided with Eastern Avalonia during Early Devonian times (the Acadian Event).\r\n•\tSinistral re-alignment of terrane boundaries (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n\r\n<h2>The Caledonian Orogenic Belt</h2>\r\nThe Caledonian–Appalachian Orogen can be traced (pre-Atlantic drift), for some 7500 km south-west to north-east, from south-eastern USA through the British Isles to Scandinavia, Greenland, and Ny Friesland. It is generally accepted that sedimentation and igneous activity took place at, or near, the margins of an ocean (the Iapetus) that separated the Laurentian and Gondwanaland plates, over a period from the Precambrian through the early Palaeozoic. From studies of fauna, sedimentary history, igneous activity, structural and metamorphic evolution, and palaeomagnetism on its two sides, it is considered that deformation of sediments and volcanic rocks, resulting from the episodic closure of the Iapetus Ocean, took place through the early Palaeozoic to culminate in continental collision during the early Devonian.\r\nThe British Caledonides–Scottish Highlands\r\nIn the British Isles, two groups of contrasting terranes are of long standing: the Scottish Highland Terranes (and Irish equivalents) with their early, 590–480 Ma Caledonian (= Grampian) deformation and metamorphism, and the Southern Upland, Lake District, and Welsh Terranes (and their Irish equivalents) dominated by late or end-Caledonian (= Acadian) deformation and low-grade metamorphism, dated around 400 Ma. The first of these areas itself has a complex history, but culminated with the Grampian Orogeny imposed on rocks ranging in age from Archaean basement (Lewisian) through the Proterozoic (Moine) to the Late Proterozoic to early Cambrian (Dalradian) cover. The principal deformation events took place before 490 Ma, resulting in polyphase folding, thrusting, and regional low- to high-grade metamorphism. Subsequent folding in this area has not been precisely dated, but it pre-dates intrusion of Upper Silurian to Lower Devonian granites and faulting on the Great Glen Fault system. Some of this late folding, and certainly the faulting, must correlate in time with the late-Caledonian deformation of other terranes.\r\nMidland Valley\r\nBetween the Scottish Highlands and the Southern Uplands lies the enigmatic terrane of the Midland Valley. Apart from some indirect evidence here of a granulite basement, the oldest exposed rocks comprise the Lower Ordovician Ballantrae Complex, commonly interpreted as obducted Iapetus Ocean crust, with a complex and little-understood terrane history. These rocks are unconformably overlain by Middle Ordovician to Middle Silurian sediments which contrast strongly in their sedimentology and structural and metamorphic state with the rocks of the Southern Uplands. In the south-east of the Midland Valley, they are very weakly folded and appear to be conformable with the Lower Devonian, although folding preceded Gedinnian Series deposition in the north-east in the Pentland Hills. The Middle Devonian is missing and the Upper Devonian is strongly unconformable on older rocks, with evidence, in this interval, of locally strong folding and faulting. Another element of the Midland Valley Terrane is a narrow zone of possibly ophiolitic rocks which parallels the Highland Boundary Fault: this has small areas of Arenig Series, Middle Ordovician and Upper Ordovician sediments, each apparently with a distinct structural history.\r\nSouthern Uplands The deformation events that are the subject of this GCR Block are generally construed to be the result of the closing of the Iapetus between the mid-Ordovician Period and the early Devonian, associated with marginally directed subduction zones. There have been many suggestions as to how both large-scale and small-scale structures may be related to these models. On the north-western margin, the arguments for NW-directed subduction in the Southern Uplands have been strengthened by the stratigraphical, sedimentological, and large-scale structural evidence. The distinctive stratigraphical and structural arrangement of these rocks has been used to argue for accretion above a descending oceanic plate. According to the accretionary prism model, deformation in the Southern Uplands, unlike that in the Lake District and Wales, would be expected to have developed throughout late Ordovician and Silurian times, perhaps culminating with the development of the finite cleavage in the early Devonian. Thus the upright SE-verging and steep reverse faults have been interpreted as original flat-lying, ocean-verging and NW-dipping thrusts respectively, which have been rotated into their present steep attitudes in the accretion process. The cleavage, which cuts across the folds, has been attributed to the late-stage closure of the Iapetus. However, there is still much debate concerning the detailed relationship of the structures observed, to the evolution of the supposed accretionary prism (a wedge-shaped pile of deformed rocks) above the subducting plate.",

Closure of the Iapetus Ocean had led to the development of a suture running ENE–WSW across northern England, with differing Lower Palaeozoic geological histories on either side.The Caledonian structure of England and Wales was strongly influenced by a ‘Midlands Microcraton’ in central England.To the east of this, Caledonian structures trend north-west–south-east, but to the west and north the trend is north-east–south-west.A major feature of the palaeogeography of Britain during Early Carboniferous times is the land area of the Wales–Brabant Massif, formerly known as St George’s Land, which is, at least in part, a remnant of this Midlands Microcraton.\r\nMajor collision was taking place through Central Europe during the Early Carboniferous Subperiod as a result of closure of the Rheic Ocean, but to the north of this, in Britain, extensional tectonics prevailed.An overall north–south stretching is envisaged, although east–west tension has also been suggested.In England and Wales north of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the combination of (probable) north–south extension combined with the inherited Caledonian structures led to the development of asymmetric grabens with relative subsidence partly controlled by the position of low-density granite plutons.Rifting was pulsed, with particularly active episodes in Chadian–early Arundian and in mid–late Asbian times.Significant rifting also took place during Courceyan times.\r\nAreas undergoing slow subsidence and thus accommodating a relatively thin Lower Carboniferous succession have been variously called ‘blocks’, ‘highs’, ‘horsts’, ‘shelves’ or ‘platforms’, and the areas undergoing more rapid subsidence as ‘basins’, ‘troughs’, ‘gulfs’ or ‘lows’.\r\nSouth of the Wales–Brabant Massif, the Culm Trough and the shelf area bordering it are remnants of a back-arc basin relating to northwards subduction and closure of the Rheic Ocean.In Scotland, between the Grampian Mountains to the north and the Southern Uplands to the south, a major rift, the Midland Valley, formed, controlled by movements on inherited Caledonian faults.\r\nIn late Dinantian times, uplift of source areas led to southwards progradation of a giant clastic delta complex which rapidly filled the basinal areas.At this time, active rifting largely ceased and subsidence in Namurian and Westphalian times was regional and thermally driven.\r\nThe final closure of the Rheic Ocean led to the ‘Variscan’ or ‘Hercynian Orogeny’ (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=102' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South-West England'>VAR-STR-SW</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=103' title='Click for details of GCR Block Variscan Structures of South Wales and the Mendips'>VAR-STR-WM</a>) during late Westphalian and Permian times.South of the Wales–Brabant Massif, compression resulted in thrust faulting and nappe emplacement.In northern Britain, inversion of Lower Carboniferous half-graben and subsequent erosion led to the development of a Permian–Carboniferous angular unconformity.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nFor the Dinantian stratigraphy of Britain sites were selected according to palaeogeographically defined GCR Blocks.\r\n•\tDinantian of Scotland – Midland Valley Basin\r\n•\tDinantian of northern England and North Wales – Northumberland Trough; Lake District and Alston Blocks; Stainmore Basin and Askrigg Block; Craven Basin; Derbyshire Platform, North Staffordshire Basin and the Hathern Shelf; and North Wales Shelf;\r\n•\tDinantian of southern England and South Wales – South Wales–Mendip Shelf\r\n•\tDinantian of Devon and Cornwall\r\nAlthough the relatively common invertebrate fossils do not have a separate selection category in the GCR in their own right, the scientific importance of many stratigraphy sites lies in their fossil content. Therefore, some of the GCR sites are selected specifically for their fossil fauna, which facilitates stratal correlation and enables the interpretation of the environments in which the animals lived. Moreover, some sites have international significance because they have yielded fossils that are the ‘type’ material for a taxonomic group.\r\n\r\n<h2>Palaeontology, fauna and flora</h2>\r\nIn the early 20th century the first coral–brachiopod zonation schemes for the British Lower Carboniferous sequence were established; subsequently a proliferation of biostratigraphical schemes for the Lower Carboniferous successions of north-west Europe has evolved based principally on the distribution of miospores, conodonts, foraminifera and ammonoids.",

    "Name": "Fluvial Geomorphology of Scotland",
    "Description": "A general introduction to British fluvial geomorphology is provided under <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=30' title='Click for details of GCR Block Fluvial Geomorphology of England'>FLU-GME-EG</a>.\r\nScottish rivers afford a richer variety of process, form and pattern than other UK rivers because of the greater diversity of environments within which they have evolved. This arises because of deeply dissected relief (particularly to be found in the Scottish Highlands), the juxtaposition of reaches from highland, upland and lowland environments, and the marked rainfall gradient across Scotland from west to east. This GCR Block encompasses the specific geomorphic controls that govern the operation of fluvial processes in Scotland, together with the spatial and temporal patterns of the resulting river systems.\r\nIn terms of the hydrological setting for Scottish rivers, a marked west–east precipitation gradient exists, with Glen Quoich having a mean annual precipitation >3000 mm but Aberdeenshire, Fife and Berwickshire recording <700 mm. This, when combined with generally low evapotranspiration losses, results in parts of the NW Highlands recording rainfall:runoff ratios >75% and the majority of Scotland recording ratios > 50%. This is in marked contrast to East Anglia where rainfall : runoff ratios can be as low as 25%. This rainfall-controlled pattern of runoff gives the River Tay by far the largest mean flow for any river in Britain, although in terms of drainage area it ranks only third.\r\nGiven this pattern of runoff, it might be expected that the largest and most powerful rivers would also be located in the NW Highlands and SW Grampians. But this is not the case because of the extremely asymmetric location of the main east–west watershed in Scotland. This asymmetry has arisen because the most active ice streams during the Pleistocene Epoch operated from an east–west iceshed located close to the present-day watershed. This in turn was inherited from a watershed that developed during the latter part of the Tertiary sub-Era. To the west of the present-day watershed, steep and relatively short icestreams produced a series of deeply incised glaciated valleys often with hanging tributary valleys (e.g. Glen Coe). Following deglaciation, the relatively short river systems in this part of Scotland have merely occupied courses previously excavated by the major icestreams. In contrast, the largest rivers in the Highlands (e.g. River Tay, River Spey and River Dee) flow eastwards from the main watershed and it is only in the Southern Uplands that the watershed between the River Clyde and River Tweed is more symmetrically located.\r\nAnother significant legacy of repeated Pleistocene glaciation is the calibre of the bed material, with many of the large rivers of Scotland having gravel beds down to their marine limits (e.g. the Spey, Tay and Tweed). This arises not because such material is continuously transported from source to mouth but because lateral channel migration constantly reworks the Late Quaternary glacial and glaciofluvial deposits adjacent to the valley floors. A further inherited glacial feature is that many of the upper reaches of upland channels are cut directly into bedrock, these occasionally being so confined that they represent the courses of former subglacial meltwater channels (e.g. Corrieshalloch Gorge on the River Droma and Randolph’s Leap on the River Findhorn). Such former meltwater channels are a persistent element in the upper reaches of many Highland rivers, producing stepped long profiles in which alluvial reaches occupy a series of basins separated from each other by bedrock sections. The precise pattern of such alternating alluvial and bedrock channels owes much to differential glacial erosion during the Devensian and is exemplified particularly well in the Middle and Lower River Findhorn and the Tay–Tummel–Garry river system.\r\nAnother result of selective glacial erosion is the presence of many lochs within river courses. A striking example of this is the Tay drainage system with four lochs > 0.1 km3 in volume. These lochs have a twofold impact in terms of fluvial processes: they serve to dampen flood waves and thus reduce the potential stream power in the lower reaches of major river systems, and they also act as sediment traps. However, not all lochs contained within major river systems owe their origin to glacial scouring; others (e.g. Lochs Insh, Alvie and Morlich within the River Spey drainage system) are former large kettle holes which, on final deglaciation, became incorporated into the present-day drainage system.\r\nA variety of channel types arises from the operation of the major controls and these in turn generate a number of distinctive spatial patterns. A typical Scottish river originating in the Highlands and flowing to the sea will commence as a boulder-bed torrent, often interrupted by bedrock reaches. Such a channel will be relatively stable over short timescales and subject to major episodic adjustment only during rare extreme floods (e.g. the Allt Mor, Glenmore). In addition, many upland channels pass through ‘alluvial basins’ (glaciated valley floors infilled with alluvium) which are often separated from each other by further bedrock reaches; for example Glen Derry and Abhainn an t-Srath Chuileannaich. Downstream from these initial channel types, the reduction of bed material size and channel slope is often combined with a widening of the valley floor. This typically results in a low-sinuosity wandering gravel river which, depending on local controls, may exhibit both divided and undivided channels of variable sinuosity, for example the Rivers Tulla and Feshie and Dorback Burn. In sediment transport terms such reaches are bedload channels, but the number of competent transport events in any year will vary greatly according to bed material size and the associated entrainment function.\r\nThe supply of bed material from tributary valleys and the location of undercut terraces adjacent to the valley floor also controls the degree of channel stability (e.g. on the upper River Findhorn and the upper River Dee). In such reaches the channel is overwhelmingly an alluvial channel reworking its floodplain and only occasionally confined by bedrock reaches and gorge-like sections. Moving further downstream, the channel may be interrupted by a loch which acts as a sediment trap; for example the River Balvag and Loch Lubnaig. However, the channel gradient downstream of the outfall combined with a renewed sediment supply from banks and tributary streams usually ensures that the river continues to display many of the characteristics noted above.\r\nTruly lowland reaches constitute only a relatively small proportion of the total channel length of an idealized large river system in Scotland. This arises because lowland areas are confined to a narrow coastal fringe around the Highlands and Southern Uplands and become extensive only within Central Scotland. In this central belt, in contrast to their upland counterparts, lowland rivers are generally characterized by sand-sized rather than gravel beds. Low channel gradients plus river training along many reaches means that these channels are highly stable and it is only rarely that major reworking of the floodplain occurs (e.g. the River Clyde at Carstairs and the lower Endrick Water). Nevertheless, bedrock controls can still provide dramatic changes in channel type, and gorge-like reaches are locally significant even in the Central Lowlands (e.g. the River Clyde at Falls of Clyde and the River Devon at Rumbling Bridge). The final sections of the major river systems which terminate in the Central Lowlands are the well-known firths or estuaries (e.g. Firth of Tay) which serve as major long-term sediment stores.\r\nSuch is the sequence of channel types in an idealized large Scottish river system originating in the Highlands or Southern Uplands and terminating at the coast, but other types of channel exist alongside this idealised model. Three types which are especially important are ‘integrated’, ‘discordant’ and ‘progressive’ channel systems. The integrated system typically occurs in upland areas and comprises a sediment source, a transportational reach and a depositional sink all within a small area of only a few square kilometres. The sediment sources are often areas of deeply dissected till, while the depositional sinks take the form of major alluvial fans. In these integrated drainage systems, the sediment source and the depositional sink are end members of a sequence in which channel morphology and processes rapidly change downstream. There may be abrupt changes in control within this marked downstream change. The concept of an ‘integrated’ system is therefore scale dependent.\r\nThe glacial legacy and recent climatic history of Scotland exercise a strong control on the pattern of downstream fining. Scottish rivers (e.g. the upper River Dee, River Feshie and River Findhorn) do not display classic progressive downstream fining throughout their length. Instead, there is local fining, often within the context of glacially eroded basins that have subsequently been infilled by alluvium and which display a local base-level control (e.g. lower Glen Derry and the Allt Dubhaig). The triggers that induce a local coarsening of bed material downstream are lateral inputs derived either from glacigenic sediments (on or adjacent to the valley floor), or from alluvial fans at the mouth of steep tributary valleys. It is rare that downstream fining develops more than a few kilometres before one or other of these disturbing controls exerts an influence. For similar reasons, the long profiles of Scotland’s larger rivers (e.g. the River Tay) do not conform to the familiar concave up model, but instead comprise a series of concave segments, often linked by steeper units where the river flows through a bedrock-controlled section.\r\nIn terms of specific types of channel patterns, a rich variety has been identified for Scottish rivers. The traditional distinction between ‘braided’ and ‘meandering’ channels is inappropriate for many rivers in Scotland, since a given reach often exhibits both types of pattern simultaneously; or, if studied over a number of years, reveals an alternating development of divided and undivided channels of varying sinuosity.",

    "Description": "The geology represented by this GCR Block are metamorphosed rocks of Precambrian age in Scotland that are older than the Dalradian/Torridonian (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=25' title='Click for details of GCR Block Dalradian'>DAL</a>, <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=99' title='Click for details of GCR Block Torridonian'>TOR</a>). ‘Precambrian’ is a broadly used term for rocks that pre-date the Cambrian Period (540–510 Ma), i.e. were formed before the Phanerozoic Eon. It encompasses a vast span of time, extending back to at least 4000 Ma, and has been subdivided into two Eons, the Archaean and the younger Proterozoic Eon. The Precambrian rocks selected for this block belong to Archaean Eon.\r\n\r\n<h2>Origin</h2>\r\nThe crust of north-west Scotland, together with parts of Greenland and North America that make up the ancient continent of Laurentia, was built up mainly from igneous rocks that crystallized during Precambrian time around 2900 to 2700 million years ago (Ma).\r\nAt that time, the rocks that crop out at the surface now were deep in the Earth's crust. They were deformed and metamorphosed at very high temperatures, producing gneisses with a folded layering – the Lewisian Complex. There were, in fact, two periods of deformation and metamorphism, separated by a stable period when the crust fractured and allowed in basic magma that crystallized as a set of dykes (Scourian dykes). The early metamorphic event was of high grade (where the typical mafic mineral in the rock is pyroxene), whereas the later ‘Laxfordian’ metamorphism was of medium grade (typical mafic mineral is hornblende).\r\nThe Lewisian gneisses are overlain unconformably by the unmetamorphosed cover of Torridonian or younger strata, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=99' title='Click for details of GCR Block Torridonian'>TOR</a>, and can be thought of as the ‘basement rocks’ of the crust of Britain brought to the surface during tectonic events.\r\nSeveral rock types are found in the Lewisian Complex. They can be broadly subdivided into felsic gneisses (rich in light-coloured minerals like feldspar and quartz), mafic gneisses (containing a large proportion of dark mafic minerals such as pyroxene, hornblende, or biotite mica), and ultramafic gneisses (containing exclusively mafic minerals). The felsic gneisses are the most abundant, and are the metamorphosed equivalents of granite or, more characteristically, tonalite (like granite but without potassium feldspar). Mafic and ultramafic gneisses are generally found together, and can be understood as metamorphosed varieties of gabbro and peridotite.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of intrusive and extrusive igneous activity in the UK that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma (see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>), which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian (417–354 Ma) time.\r\nThere is at present no agreed definition of the term ‘Caledonian’, but is taken here to include all of the convergent tectonic and magmatic events arising from the closure of the ‘proto-Atlantic’ Iapetus Ocean in which many of the rocks of Late Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic age had been deposited. It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’. By this definition, most Caledonian igneous rocks of Britain range in age from about 500 Ma (earliest Ordovician) to around 390 Ma (end Early Devonian), with related activity continuing to around 360 Ma (end Late Devonian) in Orkney and Shetland.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and, by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, Baltica (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins.\r\nMagma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe exact sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is the subject of much debate, in which the distribution, nature and timing of the igneous activity are crucial evidence.\r\nThe tectonic history of the Caledonian Orogeny in Britain can be divided into the following time intervals, linking together coeval magmatic events in the various terranes across the whole orogenic belt.\r\n•\tEarly Ordovician –Tremadoc and Arenig\r\n•\tMid-Ordovician –Llanvirn and Llandeilo\r\n•\tLate Ordovician –Caradoc and Ashgill\r\n•\tEarly and mid-Silurian –Llandovery and Wenlock\r\n•\tLate Silurian and Early Devonian –Ludlow to Emsian\r\n•\tMid- and Late Devonian –Eifelian to Famennian\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nWithin this GCR Block, sites fall into natural ‘networks’, which are based upon petrological or tectonic affinites, age and geographical distribution. The ten networks are:\r\n•\tOrdovician Volcanic Rocks and Ophiolites of Scotland\r\n•\tOrdovician intrusions of the NE Grampian Highlands of Scotland\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of the Lake District\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of Central England\r\n•\tOrdovician Igneous rocks of Wales\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: alkaline ntrusions of the NW highlands of Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: granitic intrusions of Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian Plutonic rocks: northern England\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian volcanic rocks: Scotland\r\n•\tSilurian and Devonian volcanic rocks: Wales\r\nSites that are important for unravelling the geological history of these major igneous events will also be important for demonstrating general processes of igneous rock petrology, magma evolution and emplacement, and vulcanology (e.g. Cauldron Subsidence theory at Glencoe) irrespective of their role in building up a picture of the sequence of events of geological history of the UK.\r\nWeighting of site selection has focussed on identifying those sites where the contribution of Caledonian igneous rocks of Great Britain to igneous petrology and the understanding of igneous processes and have played a major role in the initiation, testing and evolution of many theories of igneous processes.",

Rocks that formed during the Cambrian Period constitute the Cambrian System; the Tremadoc Epoch was the first of the Ordovician Period, 495–440 Ma).\r\nThe Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of Britain are essentially of marine origin; freshwater and subaerial deposits have been identified only in settings where volcanic edifices were raised above sea level.  Within the marine setting there are rocks of the widest variety, from sandstones and limestones of the shoreline and shallow shelves to beds that accumulated in deep basins or on the continental slopes.  Transects from shelf to basin are seen in both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and examples of shallow- and deep-water deposits are recognized in both Anglo-Welsh and Scottish areas.\r\nThe traditional series of the Ordovician System are Tremadoc (oldest), Arenig, Llanvirn, Caradoc and Ashgill (youngest).  There are no globally agreed divisions of the Cambrian System, although ‘Lower’, ‘Middle’ and ‘Upper’ are widely used, but not universally defined.\r\nFor details of Cambrian–Ordovician stratigraphy, palaeogeography, palaeontology and GCR site selection, see <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=16' title='Click for details of GCR Block Cambrian'>CAM</a>.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of Earth history that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma, which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian (417–354 Ma) time, as represented by geological features present in the Southern Uplands; geological structures produced elsewhere by the same events are covered by other Blocks: the Caledonian Structures of the Lake District and Caledonian Structures of Wales, for both geographical and geological reasons. See the GCR Blocks <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=15' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of Wales'>CAL-STR-WL</a>.\r\nIgneous rocks that formed as a result of the Caledonian Orogeny are encompassed by the <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a> GCR Block.\r\nThere is at present no agreed definition of the term ‘Caledonian’, but is taken here to include all of the convergent tectonic and magmatic events arising from the closure of the ‘proto-Atlantic’ Iapetus Ocean in which many of the rocks of Late Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic age had been deposited. It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, ‘Baltica’ (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data, which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins. Magma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe generally accepted sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is as follows.\r\n•\tClosure of the Tornquist Sea between Eastern Avalonia and Baltica, followed by strike-slip movement along the Tornquist Suture.\r\n•\tAnticlockwise rotation of Baltica, followed by convergence with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the ‘Scottish’ sector of the Laurentian margin and closure during early to mid-Silurian times.\r\n•\tOblique convergence of Eastern Avalonia with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the Laurentian margin, resulting in closure by the early Silurian in the ‘Irish’ sector and later, mid-Silurian closure in the ‘Scottish’ sector. The junction between the two fused plates passes through the Solway Firth in Britain and is known as the Iapetus Suture.\r\n•\tProtracted continent–continent collision between Laurentia and Eastern Avalonia plus Baltica, with underthrusting beneath part of the Laurentian margin (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n•\tSeparation of a further microcontinent, Armorica, from the margin of Gondwana, which then collided with Eastern Avalonia during Early Devonian times (the Acadian Event).\r\n•\tSinistral re-alignment of terrane boundaries (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n\r\n<h2>The Caledonian Orogenic Belt</h2>\r\nThe Caledonian–Appalachian Orogen can be traced (pre-Atlantic drift), for some 7500 km south-west to north-east, from south-eastern USA through the British Isles to Scandinavia, Greenland, and Ny Friesland. It is generally accepted that sedimentation and igneous activity took place at, or near, the margins of an ocean (the Iapetus) that separated the Laurentian and Gondwanaland plates, over a period from the Precambrian through the early Palaeozoic. From studies of fauna, sedimentary history, igneous activity, structural and metamorphic evolution, and palaeomagnetism on its two sides, it is considered that deformation of sediments and volcanic rocks, resulting from the episodic closure of the Iapetus Ocean, took place through the early Palaeozoic to culminate in continental collision during the early Devonian.\r\nThe British Caledonides–Scottish Highlands\r\nIn the British Isles, two groups of contrasting terranes are of long standing: the Scottish Highland Terranes (and Irish equivalents) with their early, 590–480 Ma Caledonian (= Grampian) deformation and metamorphism, and the Southern Upland, Lake District, and Welsh Terranes (and their Irish equivalents) dominated by late or end-Caledonian (= Acadian) deformation and low-grade metamorphism, dated around 400 Ma. The first of these areas itself has a complex history, but culminated with the Grampian Orogeny imposed on rocks ranging in age from Archaean basement (Lewisian) through the Proterozoic (Moine) to the Late Proterozoic to early Cambrian (Dalradian) cover. The principal deformation events took place before 490 Ma, resulting in polyphase folding, thrusting, and regional low- to high-grade metamorphism. Subsequent folding in this area has not been precisely dated, but it pre-dates intrusion of Upper Silurian to Lower Devonian granites and faulting on the Great Glen Fault system. Some of this late folding, and certainly the faulting, must correlate in time with the late-Caledonian deformation of other terranes.\r\nMidland Valley\r\nBetween the Scottish Highlands and the Southern Uplands lies the enigmatic terrane of the Midland Valley. Apart from some indirect evidence here of a granulite basement, the oldest exposed rocks comprise the Lower Ordovician Ballantrae Complex, commonly interpreted as obducted Iapetus Ocean crust, with a complex and little-understood terrane history. These rocks are unconformably overlain by Middle Ordovician to Middle Silurian sediments which contrast strongly in their sedimentology and structural and metamorphic state with the rocks of the Southern Uplands. In the south-east of the Midland Valley, they are very weakly folded and appear to be conformable with the Lower Devonian, although folding preceded Gedinnian Series deposition in the north-east in the Pentland Hills. The Middle Devonian is missing and the Upper Devonian is strongly unconformable on older rocks, with evidence, in this interval, of locally strong folding and faulting. Another element of the Midland Valley Terrane is a narrow zone of possibly ophiolitic rocks which parallels the Highland Boundary Fault: this has small areas of Arenig Series, Middle Ordovician and Upper Ordovician sediments, each apparently with a distinct structural history.\r\nSouthern Uplands The deformation events that are the subject of this GCR Block are generally construed to be the result of the closing of the Iapetus between the mid-Ordovician Period and the early Devonian, associated with marginally directed subduction zones. There have been many suggestions as to how both large-scale and small-scale structures may be related to these models. On the north-western margin, the arguments for NW-directed subduction in the Southern Uplands have been strengthened by the stratigraphical, sedimentological, and large-scale structural evidence. The distinctive stratigraphical and structural arrangement of these rocks has been used to argue for accretion above a descending oceanic plate. According to the accretionary prism model, deformation in the Southern Uplands, unlike that in the Lake District and Wales, would be expected to have developed throughout late Ordovician and Silurian times, perhaps culminating with the development of the finite cleavage in the early Devonian. Thus the upright SE-verging and steep reverse faults have been interpreted as original flat-lying, ocean-verging and NW-dipping thrusts respectively, which have been rotated into their present steep attitudes in the accretion process. The cleavage, which cuts across the folds, has been attributed to the late-stage closure of the Iapetus. However, there is still much debate concerning the detailed relationship of the structures observed, to the evolution of the supposed accretionary prism (a wedge-shaped pile of deformed rocks) above the subducting plate.",

    "Description": "The Quaternary Period is the most recent major subdivision of the geological record, spanning the late Cainozoic Era. Traditionally, it is divided into two intervals of epoch status – the Pleistocene and Holocene. The Holocene Epoch occupies only the last 10 000 years of geological time and is the warm interval or interglacial in which we now live. Consequently, it is often regarded as part of the Pleistocene rather than a separate epoch. In a strict geological sense, the base of the Pleistocene Epoch (and therefore that of the Quaternary Period) is defined in Italy at the type locality of Vrica, where it is dated to about 1.64 Ma (million years ago); it is now well established that the current warm period, the Holocene Epoch, is simply the latest interglacial in a long series of profound climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last 2.4 Ma.\r\nThe deep-sea sedimentary record shows that up to 50 ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ climatic oscillations have occurred within the last 2.4 Ma. Equally, the glacial and interglacial periods cannot be characterized simply as ‘cold’ or ‘warm’, respectively; the ice ages were not unbroken in their frigidity since the exceptionally cold phases (stadials) were punctuated by warmer periods (interstadials), in some cases lasting for several thousand years. The fundamental characteristic of the Quaternary Period is therefore one of change through time and space in geomorphological processes, floras, faunas and environmental conditions, all modulated by the changing climate. The record of such changes is preserved in a variety of landforms, sediment sequences and organic remains.\r\nThe abrupt onset of the late Cainozoic ice ages is, as yet, unexplained. However, the succession of ice ages (glacials) and interglacials has occurred at known frequencies, and changes in insolation (the receipt of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and throughout its atmosphere) associated with the Earth’s orbital rhythms are now established as the principal external driving forces of the Earth’s climatic system.\r\n\r\n<h2>Subdividing the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nThe oxygen isotope chemistry of the deep-sea sediment pile now provides the main basis for subdividing the Quaternary swedimentary record, with a number of successive oxygen isotope stages recognized globally. These stages, running counter to normal geological practice, are numbered backwards in time and down through the geological column. Warm periods with correspondingly low volumes of ice are given odd numbers; the present interglacial, the Holocene, is numbered as Stage 1. Times of high ice volume (glacials) are given even numbers; the last main cold phase in Britain, the Late Devensian, being numbered as Stage 2. Stages are also divided into sub-stages, for example, Stage 5 into sub-stages 5a–5e, often reflecting stadial or interstadial events.\r\nThe position in the deep-sea sediment cores of a major reversal in the Earth’s magnetic field, the Matuyama–Brunhes Reversal at 780 ka, provides a yardstick with which to calibrate the oxygen isotope record. The boundaries of the different isotope stages have also been adjusted and refined with respect to known orbital patterns\r\n\r\n<h2>British Quaternary environments</h2>\r\nIn Britain, the area covered by ice varied considerably during different glaciations. During the last (Late Devensian) glaciation, ice extended as far south as the north Midlands, impinging on the north coast of East Anglia and covering most of South Wales. During earlier glaciations ice sheets were more extensive, but probably never reached farther south in south-central and south-east England than the present Thames Valley. In the South-West, there is a longstanding debate over whether pre-Devensian ice masses reached the northern shores of Devon and Cornwall and even the Isles of Scilly.\r\nThe major shifts of climate that characterize the Quaternary Period were accompanied by equally profound changes in environmental conditions that left a strong imprint on the landforms, fossils and sediments of Britain. During the cold or glacial stages, substantial areas were subjected to the effects of glacial erosion and deposition and a wide range of landforms and deposits was produced.\r\nAs ice sheets melted, vast quantities of meltwater were liberated, giving rise to characteristic suites of landforms and deposits.\r\nRepeated climate change also subjected the flora and fauna of Britain to stress: fundamental changes in the distribution of plants and animals took place. Beyond the margins of the ice sheets and during the cold climatic phases of the Quaternary Period, periglacial conditions prevailed. Such environments were characterized by frost-assisted processes and by a range of frost- and ground ice-generated landforms and deposits. Mass wasting (downslope movement of soil on both large and small scales) and increased wind action were prevalent, also producing a range of characteristic features. In the fossil record, the flora and fauna of these cold periods is, not surprisingly, restricted in diversity and dominated by cold-tolerant species; large areas were dominated by tundra vegetation.\r\nConversely, the warmer or interglacial periods of the Quaternary are characterized by the absence of glacial, periglacial and glaciofluvial features, and there were times when chemical weathering, soil formation and the accumulation of organic sediments took place. Variations in the quantity and type of pollen grains preserved in organic deposits, such as peats and lake muds, have been used to define systems of pollen zones or pollen biozones. These zones are characterized by particular vegetational assemblages which can be used to chart sequences of vegetational, climatic and environmental change. Traditionally, these have been used as the principal basis for distinguishing between various interglacial phases in the land-based Quaternary record and for the definition of chronostratigraphic stages. Unfortunately, although several distinctive interglacial episodes in the British Pleistocene can be distinguished, very little evolution of the flora actually occurred, thus hindering biostratigraphic correlation. However, interglacial periods can be differentiated broadly on the basis of pollen assemblage zone biostratigraphy, with individual parts of interglacial cycles (sub-stages) being recognized; for example, pre-temperate, early temperate, late temperate and post-temperate sub-stages. Interglacial environments in the British Isles were generally characterized by a climax vegetation of mixed deciduous oak forest. The last time Britain experienced conditions similar to today was about 125 ka, when the interglacial (part of the Ipswichian Stage) lasted about 10 ka.\r\nUnlike the flora, some elements of the Quaternary fauna have evolved. Therefore, certain glacial and interglacial periods can be characterized broadly by distinctive fossil assemblages, particularly those of large mammals. During the last interglacial, for example, creatures such as the hippopotamus, lion and elephant were indigenous to Britain. Likewise, fossils of both terrestrial and marine molluscs and Coleoptera (beetles) can be sensitive indicators of changing climatic conditions by analogy with their present-day environmental tolerances and geographical ranges.\r\nThe succession of glacials and interglacials and the growth and decay of ice sheets have been accompanied by equally profound changes in the coastal zone. World sea level has varied in time with the amount of water locked up in the ice sheets, and during glacial stages, world or eustatic sea levels have been lowered. The converse is true during warmer interglacial phases. The level of the land has also varied, sinking under the weight of advancing ice sheets and rising up or rebounding when they melted (isostasy). This complex interplay of changing land and sea levels has left a widespread legacy in Britain, manifested by the many beaches, shore platforms and marine sediments which now lie above the present sea level. Equally, a range of submerged shoreline features, drowned forests and valleys provide important evidence for sea levels which were relatively lower in the past.\r\nSignificant changes in the courses of rivers and their channel patterns have also occurred in the Quaternary Period. These are related to changes in discharge, sediment supply and sea level. Some rivers have reworked and built up large quantities of glacially derived sediments along their floodplains. Subsequent down-cutting has sometimes resulted in ‘staircases’ of terraces both in rock and superficial materials. In some valleys, terraces have been traced for considerable distances and been assigned specific names and ages with respect to their contained fossils and stratigraphical position; in many cases they can be ascribed with some certainty to particular interglacial or glacial phases or, more recently, to the oxygen isotope timescale.\r\n\r\n<h2>Wales in the Quaternary Period</h2>\r\nBecause of its maritime position adjacent to the warm North Atlantic, it is probable that ice in Wales grew rapidly in response to orbital changes that cooled the land. A conventional text-book view would be that, initially, ice thickened in upland hollows enlarging them into cirques. The ice flowed out from these into valleys, overdeepening and oversteepening their slopes as it moved. Converging valley glaciers coalesced on lowlands where they formed piedmont lobes which eventually grew in size to form an ice-sheet. An alternative theory proposed that ice developed, more or less everywhere, across the landscape (instantaneous glacierisation), especially on upland plateaux that were partially surrounded by higher ground. For example, it is clear that the thickest ice mass in Wales lay on plateau areas the Rhinog and the Arenig Mountains, and that it far exceeded ice thicknesses farther north in Snowdonia. Another theory proposed that marine based ice-sheets grew on shallow water continental shelf areas, such as the Irish Sea.\r\n\r\n<h2>Glacial erosion</h2>\r\nGlacial erosion was not uniform. The distribution of (i) cirques (corries) (ii) troughs (U-shaped valleys) and rock basins, and (iii) streamlines forms such as ridge tops or roches moutonees shows that glacial erosion was most intense in north-west Wales.\r\n\r\n<h2>Glacial deposition</h2>\r\nThe products of glacial erosion were transported, then deposited by a variety of means. Till (boulder clay) was deposited beneath ice as lodgement til, from within the ice as englacial till (melt-out till), and from the surface ofthe ice as it melted as supra-glacial and flow till.\r\n\r\n<h2>Fluvioglacial deposition and erosion</h2>\r\nDuring deglaciation (ice wastage) the ice margins ‘retreat’, stages in this retreat are marked by the end-moraines of the South Wales valleys, the Wye Valley, at Tregaron in the Teifi Vallet and in the upper Clwyd. Glacier thinning led to the detachment of masses of stagnant ice: for example, in the Alun and Wheeler Valleys of Clwyd, where eskers and kettle holes developed.\r\nAn impressive number of glacial meltwater channels occur in Wales. The majority appear to have been fashioned by subglacial stream erosion (that is erosion below the ice). The pattern of some, such as the Fishguard Channels, allows the course of deglaciation to be reconstructed: initially, glacial drainage in Preseli was directed southwards and south-westwards, but with ice-retreat in Cardigan Bay, the drainage was able to flow to the north.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThis GCR Block encompasses sites that merit conservation because of their significance to the geomorphological evolution and Quaternary history of Wales. Sites important for coastal and fluvial geomorphology, in the sense of modern landforms and processes, and large-scale mass-movement features are encompassed by other GCR Blocks.\r\nThe landscape of Britain displays a rich diversity of Quaternary features and evidence of environmental change, often with distinct regional associations, related for example to a combination of geology, evolution of river systems, mountain glaciation or patterns of sea-level change.\r\nA prime aim of site selection was to reflect this diversity and to select networks of sites representing the major regional variations in landscape evolution and the history of environmental change during the Quaternary Period in Britain; hence the regional approach adopted for site selection.\r\nWithin the general regional framework, the approach adopted was to identify networks of sites that represent the main landscape features, distinctive aspects of Quaternary history and the principal research themes. Such features and themes were recognized at two levels: (a) those relating to the specific characteristics of the area in question; and (b) those relating to national interests or distributions (e.g. pollen biostratigraphy and sea-level changes during the Holocene) for which regional representative sites were required. It should be noted that this categorization relates to the occurrence of the interests and does not imply differences in the importance of sites in the different categories. Thus sites selected for a regionally occurring interest are nevertheless of national importance.\r\nGCR site selection encapsulates the Pleistocene evolution of Wales. They include some unique evidence for the timing of glacier advances and retreats, major changes in sea-level, and movements of the Earth’s crust. These sites are important in a wider context, because Wales lies on the margin of the North Atlantic Ocean, where climatic change is translated, through the dynamic coupling of atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, into rapid environmental changes. These changes have been exceptionally rapid by comparison with the geological timescale, and their implications are potentially relevant to society. Thus, the Quaternary history of Wales assumes a disproportionate importance in the wider context of research in our hemisphere into why and how environments change through time.\r\nFor Wales, the site networks considered are those representing:\r\n•\tQuaternary litho and biostratigraphy: Gower\r\n•\tQuaternary litho- and biostratigraphy: west and south-west Wales\r\n•\tQuaternary litho- and biostratigraphy: north-west Wales\r\n•\tQuaternary of South Wales: erosion, deposition and fluvioglacial features\r\n•\tQuaternary of Mid Wales: erosion, deposition and fluvioglacial features\r\n•\tQuaternary of North Wales: erosion, deposition and fluvioglacial features.",

    "Name": "Coastal Geomorphology of Wales",
    "Description": "This GCR Block encompasses coastal landforms and geomorphology as developed in Wales. Many factors interplay to create the changing face of the coast that we see today: geology, glaciation, sea-level change, sediment supply, wind, wave, tide, and, increasingly, human activities.\r\nOne of the characteristics of the coastline of Great Britain is its state of continual change. Such geomorphological change may be slow and gradual, such as that which occurs where the geological inheritance has produced a resistant rocky coast, or it may also be extremely rapid, such as the almost instantaneous erosional impact of storm waves on a sand beach\r\n\r\n<h2>The geological background</h2>\r\nThe pattern of geological outcrops along the British coast has a fundamental control on the character of the coastline. Broad connections between outcrop pattern and the outline of the coast can be traced, and local geological variations control the detailed pattern of coastal form at local levels. Thus while there are differences between the older and generally far more resistant rocks of northern and western Britain and the younger and weaker rocks found in east and southern England, within each of these zones local contrasts dominate the coastal geomorphology.\r\n\r\n<h2>Geological influence on sediment supply into the coastal system</h2>\r\nA further influence of geology on coastal geomorphology is in the provision of sediment – from offshore as well as from retreating cliffs – that can be incorporated into beaches. Boulders and coarse gravel are derived from erosion of resistant rocks in areas such as Scotland and parts of the Welsh coast; flints form the commonest pebbles and cobbles on beaches in the south of England. Many ‘shingle’ (gravel) beaches have been built from offshore gravels, swept ashore as sea level rose during the Holocene marine transgression, and former sea-floor sediment has contributed to many beaches elsewhere. In places, flints are derived from erosion of the Chalk in which they occur. Farther north in England, a large proportion of the gravel has been eroded from glacial gravels and till cropping out along the coast or offshore.\r\nIn Scotland and Wales, by far the greatest source of gravel and sediment has been derived from glaciogenic sources, deposited both inland and on the adjacent shelf by either glaciers or glacial meltwater. As a result, the sediments are as varied as the rocks that were originally eroded by ice.\r\nSome coarse sediments are brought to the coast by rivers, especially in Scotland and Wales, where gradients are steep and coarse-grained material is readily transported by floods. In contrast, very little sediment other than mud (clay and silt) is now brought down the rivers of lowland Britain to the coast.\r\n\r\n<h2>The coastal marine environment: tides, waves, surges and currents</h2>\r\nIn global terms, the British Isles have unusually high tides and unusually stormy conditions; thus they have a very dynamic coast, one of the reasons why British coastal research has made such an important contribution to the world literature.\r\nHowever, each of these influences also varies greatly around Great Britain. Tidal range is highest at the head of inlets such as the Bristol Channel, and lowest on the English Channel coast between Start Point and Portsmouth, on the East Anglian coast within the North Sea, Cardigan Bay in Wales, and in Shetland in Scotland. Wave energy is highest on coasts exposed to the strong winds of western Britain and the North Atlantic swell; it is lower in such relatively sheltered areas as the Irish Sea and the North Sea. Given its western exposure to the Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel coast tends to fall into an intermediate category.\r\nBoth tidal movements and the advance of waves into shallow water create currents and these move sediment in the nearshore zone, shaping sandbanks, which in turn can affect the local conditions, for example, by forcing larger waves to break and so lose energy as they touch bottom on submerged banks, or even to break against them at low tide. In constricted bedrock channels, perhaps the best example is the Pentland Firth, the tides create extremely strong currents, and where they are channelled between sandbanks as in the Thames estuary or off Great Yarmouth, the patterns of ebb and flow (often dominating different channels) run much faster than in the open sea.\r\nTidal range has an effect on coastal landforms. Barrier beaches, behind which saltmarshes form, tend to be restricted to areas with relatively low tidal range, such as the north Norfolk coast. Such areas also have spits, which in some cases grow to many kilometres in length, for example, Blakeney Point and Orfordness.\r\nHigh tidal-ranges can occur towards the head of estuaries (or Firths in Scotland), and here saltmarshes also develop, though compared with areas of low tidal range they are generally steeper and show much stronger zonation of vegetation, such as in the Bristol Channel–Severn estuary.\r\nThe waves reaching the coast are mainly generated by winds offshore. In the case of the semi-enclosed seas of the Irish Sea and the North Sea, most waves are generated by winds blowing across relatively restricted fetches, and so have a short wave-length, short period, and are relatively steep. Thus along the coasts of these seas, the varying pattern of length of fetch is an important control over wave energies from all directions offshore as well as the frequency with which winds blow from any one direction.\r\nIn the North Sea waves from a northerly direction are generally the largest, with a secondary maximum in East Anglia for waves from the south-east. In the Irish Sea, a west-facing beach like Blackpool, Lancashire, gets its largest waves from a westerly direction, but these are always short-period waves and so put rather small volumes of water onto the beach as they break. As a result, the wide, sandy beach at Blackpool generally consists of a series of ridges and intervening runnels; the seaward slopes of the ridges may be in equilibrium with the short-period waves.\r\nLocally on the North Sea coast, ridge-and-runnel beaches are found in the shelter of a headland, limiting waves reaching the beach to those from the east or south-east; an example is in Bridlington Bay, which is protected from the larger northerly waves by Flamborough Head, Yorkshire.\r\nOn those parts of coast exposed to North Atlantic storm and swell waves, energies are much higher and the long-period waves put large volumes of water onto the beach as they break. Thus such wave conditions often produce very wide beaches with a gentle slope, for example Rhossili in South Wales, the beaches of the Western Isles and in some of the more exposed Cornish bays. Where strong regional winds build large waves, energies are very high, but it is also possible for long-period swell generated far offshore, even in the South Atlantic, to reach the western beaches. Such swell loses height as it moves across the ocean, but it can be distinguished by its typically long period. Beaches exposed to the Atlantic Ocean tend to be dominated by the high energies associated with longperiod waves, even where the exposure is indirect and the waves reach the coast after refraction.\r\nHigh wave-energies can cause considerable erosion even of resistant rocks, and will exploit structural weaknesses such as faults, joints and bedding planes. Narrow inlets, caves, stacks and natural arches are found along our higher-energy coasts even in the most resistant rocks. Good examples of such forms, eroded into resistant lithologies, are found almost everywhere on the islands of the St Kilda group and in the Shetland Islands, such as Foula and Papa Stour. They can also be found in weaker rocks where wave energies are lower, for example, the Chalk cliffs of Thanet, Kent. Waves are also responsible for the longshore drift of sediment along the coast.\r\n\r\n<h2>Coastal sediment transport</h2>\r\nThe alongshore transport of sediment (littoral or longshore drift) is achieved by waves and the currents they induce within the breaker zone. In England particularly, the widespread construction of groynes, revetments and walls has interfered with coastal sediment movement and the coastal sediment balance.\r\nThe direction is determined largely by the angle of wave approach, i.e. it is related to the dominant fetch. Thus the general direction of transport is southwards on the eastern coast of England, and eastwards on the Channel coast.\r\nIn the northern North Sea, the pattern is westward movement along the Moray Firth and mainly southward movement along the Aberdeenshire and Angus coast. The pattern around the Irish Sea is a little more complicated since it is not open to the north as is the North Sea.\r\n\r\n<h2>Sea-Level History</h2>\r\nAt the time of the last glacial maximum, some 18 000 years ago, the abstraction of water from the oceans to build the great land-based ice caps reduced global sea level to some 120–140 m below that of the present day.By the beginning of the Holocene Epoch, 10 000 years before present (BP), sea level was some 40 m below present, and as it continued to rise (the Holocene marine transgression) was within 10 m of its present stand at about 5000 years ago, and close to present level by 4000 years BP. However, the precise changes at any one site will depart from this pattern for many reasons, including crustal stability (tectonic changes, the effects of loading or removal of load by ice sheets and the oceans themselves, local sedimentation) and tidal changes as the coastal configuration has changed, as well as many other lesser effects that may lead to local departures from the general pattern of sea-level rise.\r\n\r\n<h2>GCR site selection</h2>\r\nThe GCR site-selection exercise for coastal geomorphology followed four categories (‘GCR Blocks’), one for each of England, Scotland and Wales and one for ‘Saltmarsh Geomorphology’; although three of the ‘Blocks’ are country based, comparisons were made to ensure that certain types of site occurring in each were not over-represented in a Great Britain-wide context.\r\nIn some cases, ‘representative’ sites were selected for the GCR as part of a group of related sites. Such a group of sites may show different aspects of one type of phenomenon, which shows significant regional variations in its characteristics, for example, sites with similar landforms have been selected from areas having different tidal ranges.\r\nMost of the GCR sites are dominated by one coastal landform, especially in terms of their associated research significance. However, the selected GCR sites include a number that are complex in their assemblage of linked geomorphological forms, and so they have been classified as ‘Coastal Assemblages’.\r\nThe geomorphology of the coastline is controlled by a complex interaction of factors – the dynamics of the coastal ‘cell’, geological controls (e.g. rock type and structures), the Pleistocene inheritance (isostatic and eustatic effects), sediment ‘budget’, tidal regimes as well as anthropogenic influence. It is the intention within the ‘representativeness’ rationale of the GCR to be able to demonstrate the interplay of these themes and their manifestations from the evidence present in the selected GCR sites. These themes can be thought of as providing a basis for GCR Networks, which link clusters of representative sites.\r\nUltimately, some 26 networks were identified for the GCR project.\r\nA. Cliffed coasts\r\n1. Large-scale structural control: longitudinal and transverse coasts\r\n2. Small-scale structural control: caves, arches, stacks, geos, zawns\r\n3. Cliff forms and processes: plunging cliffs, slope-over-wall, hog’s back, variety of rates of cliff retreat, differential erosion\r\n4. Exhumed and emerged forms: cliffs, benches\r\n5. Karstic development\r\nB. Shore platforms (including both contemporary and emerged features)\r\n6. Structurally controlled\r\n7. Erosionally dominated\r\nC. Beaches and intertidal sediments\r\n8. Beach orientation: relation to wave direction, swell-dominated beaches\r\n9. Beaches undergoing erosion\r\n10. Prograding beaches\r\n11. Beach phases\r\n12. Pre-existing sediment sources, including pre-existing clasts\r\n13. Emerged (‘raised’) beaches\r\n14. Cliff-foot beaches\r\n15. Dunes: rock-based, gravel-based, restricted sources, sand plains\r\n16. Spits\r\n17. Barrier beaches\r\n18. Cuspate forelands and nesses\r\n19. Tombolos and tied islands\r\n20. Intertidal sediments\r\n21. Mudflats, ridge and runnel forms\r\n22. Saltmarsh morphology – creeks, saltpans, piping\r\n23. Machair\r\nD. Coastal valleys\r\n24. Chines, truncated valleys, coastal waterfalls\r\nE. Inlets and submerged coasts\r\n25. Fjords, rias, estuaries\r\nF. Semi-enclosed bays\r\n26. Restricted sediment sources and transfers, submarine barriers, sediment sorting\r\nClearly, any one site may be helpful in elucidating several of these themes and therefore may contribute to more than one GCR Network (for example, Culbin, on the Moray Firth, provides information on sea-level change as well as gravel delivery data over the Holocene Epoch at a site characterized by well-developed dunes situated on top of spit structures).\r\nThe GCR sites encompassed by this GCR Block exclude major coastal landslides, such as Folkestone Warren; which are covered by the Mass Movements GCR Block.Also, sites that are of interest for coastal features that are particularly important for elucidating the Pleistocene history of Britain are described in the Quaternary GCR Blocks.",

    "Description": "The GCR sites selected for this GCR Block represent a major episode of Earth history that occurred as a result of the ‘Caledonian Orogeny’, lasting from about 500 million years ago (Ma) to around 360 Ma, which was a period of mountain building and continental collision that began in the Ordovician Period (which lasted from 495 to 440 Ma) and continued through Silurian (440–417 Ma) and Devonian(417–354 Ma) time, as represented by geological features present in Wales; geological structures south of the Southern Upland Fault produced elsewhere by the same events are covered by other Blocks: the Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands and Caledonian Structures of Lake District, for both geographical and geological reasons. See the GCR Blocks <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=14' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Southern Uplands'>CAL-STR-SU</a> and <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=13' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Structures of the Lake District'>CAL-STR-LD</a>.Igneous rocks that formed as a result of the Caledonian Orogeny are encompassed by the <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=12' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caledonian Igneous'>CAL-IGN</a> GCR Block\r\nThere is at present no agreed definition of the term ‘Caledonian’, but is taken here to include all of the convergent tectonic and magmatic events arising from the closure of the ‘proto-Atlantic’ Iapetus Ocean in which many of the rocks of Late Proterozoic and early Palaeozoic age had been deposited. It therefore encompasses subduction beneath the continental margins; the accretion or obduction of oceanic crust and island-arc material onto these margins; and ultimate collision of the continents, uplift and development of extensional molasse basins. Within this broad orogenic framework many separate ‘events’ are identified, such as the ‘Grampian Event’ and the ‘Acadian Event’.\r\nFor details of stratigraphy related to the Caledonian Orogeny see GCR Blocks for Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Stratigraphy: <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=5' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Llanvirn'>ARE-LLV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=6' title='Click for details of GCR Block Arenig - Tremadoc'>ARE-TRE</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=18' title='Click for details of GCR Block Caradoc-Ashgill'>CAR-ASH</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=41' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandeilo'>LDO</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=42' title='Click for details of GCR Block Llandovery'>LDY</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=44' title='Click for details of GCR Block Ludlow'>LUD</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=45' title='Click for details of GCR Block Marine Devonian'>MAR-DEV</a>; <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=60' title='Click for details of GCR Block Non-Marine Devonian'>NMAR-DEV</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>Tectonic setting and evolution</h2>\r\nThe Iapetus Ocean was created in Late Proterozoic time by the rifting and pulling apart of a large supercontinent known as ‘Rodinia’. The opening started sometime around 650 million years (Ma) ago and by the beginning of Ordovician time, at 510 Ma, the ocean was at its widest development of possibly up to 5000 km across. On one side of the ocean lay the supercontinent of Laurentia, which is represented today largely by the Precambrian basement rocks of North America, Greenland, the north of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. On the opposite side lay the supercontinent of Gondwana, consisting of the basements of South America, Africa, India, Australia, East Antarctica and Western Europe (including south Ireland, England and Wales). A separate continent, ‘Baltica’ (the basement of Scandinavia and Russia), was separated from Gondwana by an arm of the Iapetus Ocean, known as the ‘Tornquist Sea’. The wide separation is supported by palaeontological data, which shows distinctly different faunal assemblages in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of each continent and by palaeomagnetic interpretations.\r\nThe continental plates of Laurentia, Gondwana and Baltica started to converge during the early part of the Ordovician Period, initiating new tectonic and magmatic processes which marked the start of the Caledonian Orogeny. The Iapetus oceanic crust was consumed in subduction zones beneath oceanic island arcs and beneath the continental margins. Magma was being created by the melting of mantle and oceanic crustal material within and above the subduction zones and by melting within the thickened continental crust.\r\nThe generally accepted sequence and timing of events as the three plates converged is as follows.\r\n•\tClosure of the Tornquist Sea between Eastern Avalonia and Baltica, followed by strike-slip movement along the Tornquist Suture.\r\n•\tAnticlockwise rotation of Baltica, followed by convergence with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the ‘Scottish’ sector of the Laurentian margin and closure during early to mid-Silurian times.\r\n•\tOblique convergence of Eastern Avalonia with Laurentia, with subduction beneath the Laurentian margin, resulting in closure by the early Silurian in the ‘Irish’ sector and later, mid-Silurian closure in the ‘Scottish’ sector. The junction between the two fused plates passes through the Solway Firth in Britain and is known as the Iapetus Suture.\r\n•\tProtracted continent–continent collision between Laurentia and Eastern Avalonia plus Baltica, with underthrusting beneath part of the Laurentian margin (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n•\tSeparation of a further microcontinent, Armorica, from the margin of Gondwana, which then collided with Eastern Avalonia during Early Devonian times (the Acadian Event).\r\n•\tSinistral re-alignment of terrane boundaries (?mid-Silurian to Mid-Devonian).\r\n\r\n<h2>The Caledonian Orogenic Belt</h2>\r\nThe Caledonian–Appalachian Orogen can be traced (pre-Atlantic drift), for some 7500 km south-west to north-east, from south-eastern USA through the British Isles to Scandinavia, Greenland, and Ny Friesland. It is generally accepted that sedimentation and igneous activity took place at, or near, the margins of an ocean (the Iapetus) that separated the Laurentian and Gondwanaland plates, over a period from the Precambrian through the early Palaeozoic. From studies of fauna, sedimentary history, igneous activity, structural and metamorphic evolution, and palaeomagnetism on its two sides, it is considered that deformation of sediments and volcanic rocks, resulting from the episodic closure of the Iapetus Ocean, took place through the early Palaeozoic to culminate in continental collision during the early Devonian.\r\nThe British Caledonides–Wales\r\nThe Welsh Basin is now interpreted as a back-arc extensional basin within continental crust. Its original relationship to the Lake District (and the Irish equivalents) is not clear. Between the two, lies the small, isolated area of the Precambrian rocks of Anglesey. The boundary of the Anglesey terrane with the Lake District terrane is not exposed. Its south-eastern boundary, with the Welsh terrane, which has previously been interpreted as a subduction zone active in early Palaeozoic times, is now seen to be a fault boundary marking Late Precambrian strike-slip docking of the small terranes that now make up Anglesey. The significant deformation related to folds and cleavage in Wales represents, as in the Lake District, essentially an early Devonian event. There are, however, many variations on a simple pattern, attributed, variously, to soft-sediment, tectonic, and volcanic activity.",

    "Description": "A general introduction to British fluvial geomorphology is provided under <a href='default.aspx?page=4175&block=30' title='Click for details of GCR Block Fluvial Geomorphology of England'>FLU-GME-EG</a>.\r\nFluvial systems in Wales have an extended evolutionary history of considerable interest, including, in particular, phases of rejuvenation and of glaciation; together, such phases have produced a landscape mixture of waterfalls, gorges, plateau uplands and flat-bottomed valley troughs. Present-day fluvial processes acting in Wales create a considerable variety of river types, ranging from upland source area streams, active boulder-bed channels, meandering and braided reaches, through to highly sinuous channels and stable lowland rivers.\r\nThe impacts of afforestation, land drainage and improvement, and river channelization, are modifying fluvial features in the landscape to an increasing extent.\r\nThe long-term geomorphological development of the Welsh landscape has been subjected to many different interpretations. In particular, the various plateau levels have been viewed as the product of either fluvial or marine planation at time periods ranging from the Devonian Period to the Quaternary Period. Some may have been exhumed from beneath a Mesozoic cover. In recent years this situation has been somewhat modified both in the light of plate tectonic models (creating a better understanding of the effects of the widening of the North Atlantic and the development of the faulted Welsh massif in a trailing plate margin environment, for example) and also as a result of new and offshore evidence from boreholes such as that at Mochras, Gwynedd, and other land-based sites, and from exploration work in the Irish Sea. These, like the reinterpretation of weathering products fragmentarily preserved, tend to emphasise the Tertiary reduction of landscape features to low-relief surfaces, but also the importance of Neogene faulting and then relative uplift of the Welsh uplands.\r\nQuaternary glaciation added trough-like valleys and a widespread (if often thin) veneer of glacial sediments to the region. Fluvial processes are strongly conditioned by prior glacial activity. During the most recent ice-sheet glaciation, valleys were partially infilled with sediments that present rivers are currently removing. In some places, valleys may also be largely filled with glacial sediment, such that newer gorge sections have been excavated in bedrock to bypass them.\r\nIn the Holocene Epoch, the landscape has been evolving under fluctuating climatic and human influences; involving, for example, the development of a forest cover followed by its removal, and the development of upland and lowland peat deposits over the past several thousand years.",
